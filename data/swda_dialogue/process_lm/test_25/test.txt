okay i guess we 're on
yeah
central america have you ever lived in central america
i was n't in central america
talking about latin america i consider latin america to include central and south america
i did live in brazil for four years
do you think that we should have given up the panama canal
realistically i
yes
i do n't see the panama canal that has n't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it 's not really big enough to accommodate the shipping that it once did
maybe it would be better that we let the panamanians run it however i think we 're certainly justified in our actions dealing with noriega in this
there are those that that think that that the panama canal has some considerable strategic importance particularly for the military
interestingly enough my father who was in world war one and as a civil engineer they they offered him a commission as a captain if he would go in and help with the defenses of the panama canal
he had worked for united fruit company there
uh-huh
they in fact they had
this was in the late twenties
they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over
he turned them down
it 's interesting that most people do n't realize how small the canal is
have you ever been there
no
i have n't
it 's really
i have n't been there
i 've been to been to salvador
in fact we went back to visit some friends of my fathers that we went in fifty-seven i guess
interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite easily
the thing i find interesting though is the whole colonial approach
do we support the sandinistas or do we support
they thought that nicaragua if you gave them a free election they would vote for the
will you
did you ever studied the political makeup there in in nicaragua
i have a little bit
i ca n't say that i would be an expert on on the region
certainly it gets there
your
you 've got this toss up betw-
not so much a toss up but a dilemma when you want a country to have its own dominion or its free rein over its own people
we 're in this dilemma over united states believes in democracy and self determination where
that
on the other hand we believe in self preservation and not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about soviet influence in what 's considered to be the united states sphere of the world which is not only we used to see spheres
now we 're in a situation where the united states looks like we 're it now
the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic
i do n't know if you read any of the history on where the panama canal
there was an option to build it across nicaragua
there 's a big there 's a big lake
uh-huh
from a technical standpoint it would n't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in nicaragua
the united states had some
i 've forgotten what the political influence was
there were economic ties then
the issue of
if it 's in the economic interest of the united states do we go in and prevail
in other words do we make the world safe for democracy
right
if there 's no economic benefit
i think particularly if you 're looking at the at the peasant whether he 's in central america regardless of where he is is his life better off under communism or or democratic government
you look at salvador where the
he does n't care as long as he 's feeding his family
yeah
the question is does the government make a difference
if they 'll mostly leave him alone
i think that 's the difficulty that we have that it reality does n't make any difference if he has no income
apparently even some of our alleged central american leaders that are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things
it 's
yeah
yo-
in looking bu-
if you look at the region in
to their detriment they came from this hundreds of years of spanish control
the spaniards have horrible history of corrupt government greedy rulers who have been manipulating their public for their own good
if you go back to the kings and the conquistadors coming in and the incredibly horrible things they did to the native tribes
they make the things that custer did look trivial
you get
it is interesting that we look at the exploitation
we accuse some other people of exploiting them
americans have a pretty good reputation of exploiting
basically the panama canal we went in took it
absolutely
we set up
we stole it fair and square
an
teddy roosevelt did n't have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick for nothing
right
what 's america 's role there
it
with other things going on it seems to have lessened
you 've still got cuba that exerts some influence
the only thing i see about cuba though is after fidel castro dies i do n't think they 'll be a communist power anymore
i ca n't see communism in that country carrying on past him
when you take a situation where i think in particular in salvador where there is a significant under class
that
having a lot of difficulty surviving the question is would they be better off under communism
yeah
i do n't know that i would advocate communism
the question is can you can can a democracy afford the
it 's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the u s that 's essentially an underclass
right
when you get enough of them communism would feed them all
ye-
i do n't know if maybe communism is the right word for it
what we would
there would have to be some kind of
there may be a point at which you might want to consider some kind of socialistic organization or socialistic set up to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy
that
yeah
if the guys got some incentive
if he 's got
if he can raise enough coffee and bananas to where he 's got something to protect
other
right
right
whether he can export or at least set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest
cocoa leaves sell real well right now it seems
yeah
yeah
as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments
absolutely
i do n't
it 's going to be hard to
we
if you
that 's where your absolutely right is we 've got to do something in that region to encourage or to make him growing bananas profitable again
yes
the question is if somebody offered a thousand dollars a day to grow something in your backyard would you do it
right
not that we could be bought
i 've got to watch what i say here
i never know when the d i a may be listening on my phone
of course everything we 're saying is being recorded
right
of course
of course
yeah
it 's tempting
it 's got to be horribly tempting for those peasants
particularly if you 're hungry
yeah
yeah
you
it 's not just a matter of having an extra car or having a better car this is a matter for them of feeding themselves their wife and their family
you
there 's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family
there 's dishonor in not being able to do it
starving to death is not a whole lot of fun either
that
no
no
uh-huh
in reality i think what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people and help them protect themselves
not that they
i 'm not sure the catholic church is is particularly political
if
right
are you a t ier
no
i 'm not
really
that 's great
my daughter talked to a student
in general most people doing this are t iers
i guess customers too
i think a great number of students who got word of it and participated in general and voiced who heard about the program
yeah
t is got a lot of advances in it really
hopefully this will turn out to be a good program for us
we sure need the business
okay
current events
you 've got the question you can go first there since i called
i rely primarily on newspaper combined with television
that
you 're the opposite of me
i drive an hour each way to work
if i just use time
not say one which quality is the best
i guess that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio
newspapers and t v would be tied after that because maybe i 'll catch the evening news like ten o'clock on t v
i
that 's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper
okay
i really
of course you 're in a different part of the country
i really listen to a lot of the talk shows i do n't mean the gossip ones
there 's a lot
on the weekends when i do chores or whatever
i 'm a radio hound i guess
i take the radio with me when i 'm working on my car the lawn or whatever
turn on
they have everything from lawn work lawyers news veterinarians all kinds of items
a real radio buff especially when i 'm doing chores
that 's rather interesting
yeah
i find it surprising because a lot of times it here
i 'll talk to some people here
i 'll mention some talk host
i 'll expect them to have an opinion on why i do n't like him and do n't listen
they do n't even know what the guys name is bruce williams who does financial work all over the united states
most people have n't heard of bruce williams
you probably have n't either unless you 're a radio buff
i 'd have to say i have n't either
he is in new jersey and is entrepreneur and kind of a self-made millionaire
he has it
i
it 's five seventy here
i 'm trying to
it 's on cliff
i do n't know what the
he 's on all stations
you might remember the name bruce williams
he is again national and talks about a lot of financial things
the here i just get a kick out of
we do a lot of gardening here
there 's
we have an excellent gardener here
has three hours on sunday and three hours on saturday
of course that 's not exactly current events
i 'm i am kind of a radio buff
i listen to the radio probably five or six hours a week
almost inevitably to a station that is a classical station here for music purposes
for music
we do n't use the radio as a wake up
we have a television connected to a electronic alarm system that kicks in
yeah
it comes on with c n n in the morning
yeah
that 's good
that
we wake up to television news and shower and dress and whatever to that
because of the fact that my wife and i ride to work together in a car we chat at each other rather than something else
that 's good
occasionally what we 'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in the car
we have the advantage of being able to read and drive although there seems to be from what i 've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving
my wife always wonders about that
she says look at that person he 's driving and reading at the same time
we rely pretty heavily i think on a combination of the two
i also use newsweek magazine
yeah
we tend to alternate between newsweek and time and whatever happens to be the news magazine of the year for us
right
we get
i read sporadically of commentary and a couple of other trade magazines such as that where i might read the the occasional social and even current event commentaries and everything as diverse as a c m to some of the other tabloids i get
i guess i use about eighty percent written is probably my input and twenty percent television i think i respect from a journalistic perspective current events
i 've always said that it 's really not interesting unless it 's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline
good point
that 's a good point
other than that it was a at best
yeah
it comes and goes
we 're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in raleigh
there are other
i 'm not sure what you would call them the small competing independent sort of newspapers
little small weekly things
there 's only one daily called the news and observer fondly referred to here by some as the sometimes the noise and observer
yeah
it depends
it has decent national coverage but has an extremely focused political coverage probably steeped in the southern history and the fact that this is a democratic state
local you mean
consequently everything is filtered through that republican democratic sort of glass almost unnecessarily
yeah
yeah
do n't they have city council meetings and all that
are you into any of that what 's going on in the city council and the school boards and all that
we have that addition to our paper
yeah
we have
that is
as a matter of fact they update it once a week with a special section
we pay it sort of glancing nod
we have a very good friend who is tapped into the city planning structure our developer architect friend
you get it from people then
right
i think we find out what 's happening in the city on a fairly frequent basis over a gin and tonic sort of thing
yeah
right
that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of raleigh than the paper would have anyway
my wife and i as mentioned
the question was do you get it from people too
i can say the same thing you do that my wife she reads the paper from front to back
she 'll tell me some stuff
she 'll always get mad and say you did n't read the
i always read the sports
what am i thinking of the commentaries
i ca n't even think of what it is offhand
she 's always reading something
she says why have n't you read that
i say i never have time to read it like you do
i always get a lot of my information from the newspaper through her
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess we do get it from people too
you mentioned c n n of course i mentioned radio and the c n n t v news
uh-huh
it 's the same thing that 's on the radio word for word
is that right heard there was some stuff on the radio that was equivalent to c n n
yeah
okay
it
because
we have it here at work as a matter if fact at t i
okay
we have it in the break area c n n
the reason i say that is on the radio they 'll say look at this
when i first heard c n n it only started about since the war or right before that
they would always say look at this
there would be a pause would be music and stuff
i realized that it 's the exact commentary that you have on the the news
that did n't
yeah
yeah
it 's still good
it 's still
you do n't really miss anything
uh-huh
i do enjoy since the gulf war listening to c n n radio too as well as watching c n n on t v here at work
i do n't have c n n at home
let me turn this radio off
i 'm at work right now believe it or not
where was i
i 'm
go ahead
your turn
we probably were listening to c n n fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began
we almost live and breathed it because during the war itself to the point where we began to sort of have household pact of lets turn the war off and get something done
yeah
i 've heard that
yeah
almost an addition
we could equate or relate relay well to some of the newspaper and television articles about the fact that people where having this problem in uncoupling from the events and going on with their
right
instead of watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever
because of that we began towards the middle of the war i guess about two and a half or three weeks in we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would watch fifteen minutes before fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news or our local news
we would watch c n n until six thirty then we would watch a rotating network news of a b c c b s n b c
we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one
right
we would turn the television off
we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on news that way
we would do a similar thing at ten forty-five because c n n would be wrapping their hourly coverage up
we would get the local coverage
i think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would have better state coverage rather than local coverage
three of the networks here on their local news
that
if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who murdered who or stole what from whom
yeah
that was the sort of thing that i would say is the best ( ( mumblex
) ) not news
yeah
unless there 's some trend or something that says this neighborhood has been hit forty-seven times or whatever that 's sort of more of a pattern news
i never get home early enough for those five and six o'clock
okay
what do you think of the public school system
first off do you have children that are in it
i have children that are in the plano public school systems
i am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school system
okay
then you should be a good one to know because my children are grown now
i now have grandchildren in the school system
oh
i do n't have firsthand experience right now with it
uh-huh
uh-huh
what do you think
i think the public school systems are doing a good job
i think they have a long way to go yet
i think that they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier
you know my kindergartners were on the computers
i think that with the way the world is today that 's got to be done
i think that the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them skills
right
you figure out why you 're adding it and what you 're going to do with it once you 've got it together
i think that that 's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids can not think
they literally can not come in out of the rain
that 's right
that just
i do n't care how intelligent you are if you be can not make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted
right
this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why i went into education
i think they 're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have
i think that 's very very important
yes
it is
i agree with you that they 're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren
we have a fourth grader
we have one that 's in kindergarten
i know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children were doing in the fifth and sixth grade
yeah
yeah
i tutor a girl that 's in eighth grade
her pre-algebra book is higher then some of my algebra two when i was in high school
is that scary
it 's like i going to take this home and study it before i can help you
right
they 're really moving them along
yet at the same time they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life
that 's wha-
a lot of the things that we did in school i 've never used and never will use
yes
i think that it 's appropriate to teach them why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this
correct
are you finding that since you 're doing substitute that you 're wanting to do full-time
i have a friend that 's a teacher that one of her complaints is she ca n't teach because she 's so busy filling out all the forms
yes
that 's a
d-
do you find that
filling out the forms and also all of these statewide and national wide testing things so that they compare
uh-huh
as far as i 'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say
uh-huh
it 's just a matter of how you 're going to interpret it
you waste so much time quote unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they 're possibly going to be that i think it 's crazy personally
be
uh-huh
the whole first nine weeks of school is used as a review
more than a review they 're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in october so that you know your school district shines throughout the united states
coming up
uh-huh
i think that 's totally useless
i think there 's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons
i think they 've taken it to the extent now that it 's just ridiculous
it 's like bragging on your grandchildren
right
everybody 's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth
nobody else 's children are going to ever live up to this
that 's great
that 's what they 're doing with the school systems
they 're wasting too much time on that i think
i know that this friend is in the plano school district
uh-huh
she teaches emotionally disturbed children
uh-huh
she says she has six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade
yes
because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they 're passed on or something
i did n't quite understand it
yeah
there 's a
yeah
the bottom line is always money
in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that i know and lawyers and whatnot i think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem
do you
why
why
if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students so they could become doctors the problem would go away
you think the problem is not enough doctors
i think the problem is that the doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor you are going to pay high premiums on your liability
gosh for one thing
oh
uh-huh
you think there are plenty of doctors
yeah
i do n't think there is a shortage of doctors
i do know that o b which is my field the doctors ' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year that deliver babies
uh-huh
it 's astronomical
they ca n't doing anything about that
i do n't think they 're in a conspiracy
i think it 's our fault because we as people just sue them
no
people do n't sue
people are very sue conscious
lawyers sue
if you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor
yeah
that 's probably true too
people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days
sure
when you think about reasonableness i believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory
you know what tort theory is
no
a tort is when you do something wrong
right
it
an o b g y n doctor can not control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent
that 's right
if the baby is born dead that happens
if they have complications and
it depends
i know there are guys that are real slobs
there are also people out there that are really doing their job
that 's true
they are because doctors are performing many more tests
many of them are unnecessary
they are doing so many c sections just to prevent
just to prevent a a law suit
they have all these monitors now
if anything looks even a little bit funny their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby
yeah
{ c and so } it 's costing more all around in health insurance for tests for surgery for longer hospital stay
yeah
uh-huh
i believe that there is a system already in place for health care
it 's terrible
uh-huh
they have indigent health care
you show up at parkland bleeding
you 'll get it
that 's true
in fact you 'll get it at presbyterian if you show up there too
yeah
we have that happen
we have patients that go through parkland through the clinic
uh-huh
at the last minute they come to us we ca n't turn them away
uh-huh
yeah
i think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation the problem would pretty much evaporate
yeah
i 'm for that
i 've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer i 'd like to wipe them all out
yeah
i happen to know a few
i even claim one as a friend
he 's a divorce attorney
he better not be mine
i think he 'll go nameless for the purposes of this conversation
i also know an o b g y n who has stopped practicing
yeah
some they do
he just said
they stop their o b at least
yeah
he 's not going to deliver any more babies ever
right
right
his malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year
that 's incredible
he said he had to gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice
yeah
most of them are very sincere
most of them do the best they can
yeah
they are human
occasionally something will go wrong
you can be human and catholic
i know you can be human and catholic
you 're not likely to find somebody who is going to have a less conscientious effort
yeah
no
most of them do
i really believe that
from dealing with doctors dealing with lawyers there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious
who is getting rich
insurance companies
yeah
they are
if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance
say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed
greg
i 'm not familiar
i think you guys in indiana do n't you have the death penalty
yeah
we do have the death penalty here
it 's not exercised very often
we do have it
uh-huh
i believe it
uh-huh
i know there 's a lot of problems with it seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that the person i feel does n't deserve to live does n't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in prison for life
uh-huh
right
i know there 's a lot of problems with that like they say if you put them on death row and execute them then ten years later you find out that he really did n't do it then that life was wasted just seems like in some cases that it 's a good policy
uh-huh
uh-huh
i tend to agree with you
i 've changed my views even within the last few years to be honest
when i was an undergraduate i was a member of amnesty international
uh-huh
of course at that time i thought it was stupid to kill anybody for
that
the eye for an eye was a stupid argument
right
the the more
now i live in downtown dallas i 've seen i 've seen cases in the news and all where a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder
right
right
i think that maybe a good solution to capital punishment might be reserve it solely for repeat offenders of a crime like murder
that 's a thought that i had never really had on that which seems pretty sensible
yeah
it seems sensible and failsafe
i i do n't
not completely failsafe
if a man 's convicted of two murders there 's a pretty good chance that something 's wrong
right
i also
to tell you how liberal i have turned toward this or or whatever side that is i 've kind of chosen i believe it that big time drug importers like noriega for example that these people need to be eliminated from society
right
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because really any kind of jail sentence for them is just another chance to create another power structure
yeah
you 're right there
i gue-
basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they 're going to be there for life they 're never going to be rehabilitated
uh-huh
right
right
i do n't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with
right
to me i 'm paying taxes twenty percent of my check or whatever to keep somebody alive who i in my mind should n't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society
uh-huh
i 'm all in favor of it
uh-huh
do you
are there cases where you think that the capital punishment should n't be sentenced
i really do n't know on that question
it just seems like
for instance the jeffrey dahlmer case i do n't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society
i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
uh-huh
in that case wisconsin does n't have a death penalty
he 's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
right
i think that he should not be allowed to live
then you 're kind of playing god which is never a good thing to do
that 's true
yeah
right
cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld not really that i can think of
i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers
uh-huh
uh-huh
i do n't really agree with the death penalty for people like noriega and such as that
i think that they 're operating on a more
i know that they 're causing massive problems in society up here
i do n't really think that it 's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you do n't deserve to live because they 're feeding our consumer needs
right
sure
yeah
i understand your point
yeah
of course with with dahlmer now you realize that i think it 's ohio gets to try him next they do have the death penalty
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
that was a curious case
i
yeah
that is very curious
something is sort of nightmarish to say the least
yeah
that 's right
here in texas we
i think even this last week they had another they
they use their capital punishment by lethal injection
okay
first how much television watching do you do
i do a little bit more than i think usual people do because i am here alone during the day
uh-huh
i like it just for the noise
that 's right
do you actually watch it pay attention to it
is it more of a company
it just depends on what it is
uh-huh
i have my favorite things that i do
uh-huh
okay
some fun thing to do sometime
right
what about you
i work full time
when i am not working i am running
i do not watch a lot of television
i am very selective in what i watch
right
if there 's something that i absolutely want to watch i will turn it on and watch it and then turn it off
i probably watch television four hours a week max
that 's great
yeah
if i do not find something that i really want or really want to watch then i just do not turn it on
i would rather listen to music
right
part of it is that i think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis
i think that if we are doing other things and these programs come in sometimes they influence us
we do not know where that influence came from
i think that 's partially true too
yeah
i think you have to have the will and the
i think it
right
right
right
you would be susceptible to stuff
of course i
it has to be reinforced at another level too
that 's
do you like specials
last night for example i really would have liked to have watched unsolved mysteries
those are fascinating to me
oh
if i have the opportunity i watch it
unfortunately i was with someone else who was flipping channels
oh
i hate that
i do not care a whole lot for some of the contemporary humor
right
yeah
in our comedy programs although
nobody can appreciate comedy any more than i can
i would prefer to find a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians
we have cable also
uh-huh
sometimes you can get the h b o specials
sometimes those are really pretty hysterical
uh-huh
i like to watch comedy
uh-huh
that 's something
i enjoy comedy
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess i have my old favorites
uh-huh
bob newhart is still on
uh-huh
i watch him
i enjoy that
uh-huh
something on that level
uh-huh
i also enjoy
i do not know
sunday mornings it 's channel thirteen
i watch a lot of thirteen the mclaughlin group i just laugh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's right
i think that 's so hysterical these guys
uh-huh
it 's just so much fun
it 's just a lot of fun watching that
uh-huh
i do not agree with a whole lot of the stuff the they say
right
right
yeah
i like to be entertained
i really do
yeah
i watch it for entertainment
i also watch it for cultural impact
i do a lot of channel thirteen channel three some of the educational channels
i watch for special programs that have a special play a special concert
i recently watched a tribute to three of the finest opera stars
that was fabulous
it was fabulous
that
i was just absolutely
yeah
you just held you breath in some of those
yeah
yeah
i was just
it makes chills all over you
i know
i may or may not even look at the t v guide
if i have time i may flip through and say this looks good if i finish this task i can watch that in an hour
if the hour comes and i do not get a chance to watch it so what
there 's certain thin-
uh-huh
i have got my t v in the kitchen here
uh-huh
i love to watch cooking shows
i really do
i do too
it makes me want to cook
i know
i eat
i get fat
i just let other people watch
i
yeah
then i eat what they cook
there 's some
in fact one of the water color shows i know has inspired me to take water color lessons
i think that 's marvelous
yeah
yeah
i took a lot of my college courses
i took some of my college courses on television
yeah
that
it 's very successful for some of those things
oh
i think i really got stung very badly about having influence in your life
at least i saw a very bad example of having television influence your life
my husband had an aunt who was addicted to soaps
uh-huh
i want you to know that became the most suspicious cantankerous contrary old woman ever walked
she got you a
absolutely
i do not know who she thought she was
she just got to the point where you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice and that attitude being demonstrated
yeah
for her to miss a soap it was a big withdrawal
that 's
she was probably depressed to begin with
i do not know
you know what i mean
she was grumpy to begin with
yeah
grumpy to begin with
yeah
there 's no doubt about that
you could clearly see those influences in my youngsters
uh-huh
i know that one day my youngsters were watching the three stooges
i always thought that was just casual slap stick comedy
i hate that show
when one tries to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench i decided that was not funny any more i really feel very strong about the bart simpson show
yeah
i
good
i think that is
the kids watch that
that 's absolutely the mouthiest kid i ever saw
i do not like it
is not that amazing
how old are your kids
mine are grown
i have grandchildren and young children around
okay
that 's
yeah
for a four year old to think bart simpson is a hero is tragic
i had forgotten about that
it 's just my husband and i of the kids shows and all that
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i do n't know
i was very careful even when my kids were at home
yeah
when they were young i really did watch what they watched
i was cau-
i sat down with them
i watched it
if i did not like it i changed the channel for them
right
right
i just wou-
we get it at school too
you might as well not reinforce it
sure
that 's right
that 's right
gosh
they are mouthy enough anyway
i remember going to sch-
my parents were a lot like too
uh-huh
kids all the watch rawhide and all those shows
uh-huh
uh-huh
my parents never let me watch anything like that
i could watch yogi bear
uh-huh
what kind of culture was that
yeah
i remember going to school the next day
everybody would be asking did you see that did you see how he did that
uh-huh
did you see
i could never participate
uh-huh
it always made me feel a little bit a loner
i
sure
i can understand how that would happen
then my parents
absolutely
i did
to
i ran my kids to death
i said i think that 's enough television for awhile
really
maybe we need to go outside
yeah
we need to go out and play and enjoy some company
i would go out with them
there 's the problem parents do not do that
they say you go outside and play
that 's true
you go rent a video up at the store and come home and sit down and watch it
yeah
i said
we did other things
i think that was
that 's something people do not do
here we are talking on that subject
that 's an interesting concept
i have got to stick in my
of course
work with kids
okay
do you participate in family reunions
i did for years
i do n't have enough family left to have them
uh-huh
did you
were they far away
were they close
i come from a family that was very large in bell county
uh-huh
my grandfather came to bell county on a covered wagon and had ten children
how neat
sometimes we would have a reunion with that group
uh-huh
sometimes we would go to arkansas where they came from and have a reunion with the entire group
that would be fun
yeah
it was a lot of fun
yeah
we have a family reunion on my mother 's side of the family that 's
it started probably about forty years ago because i remember going as a teenager before i was ever married
my husband and i went while we were still dating
it 's still going on
it used to be held at lake brownwood down at brownwood texas
now we hold it at lake texoma so that the oklahoma group does n't have to drive as far
uh-huh
we have had as many on a saturday night
it starts on friday and goes through sunday
we 've had as many on a saturday night as about two hundred and fifty
we would have group like that in arkansas
uh-huh
we 'd have two hundred and fifty or three hundred
yes
we took
our family all brought in food and everything
many of us came from a long way that we 'd usually at a motel
we bought food there
uh-huh
uh-huh
i know on sundays we all elect now to chip in
we go get kentucky fried chicken and bring out
uh-huh
we kind of take our food for three days
now our grandchildren are participating in it just love that they have all this little batch of cousins that they get to see about once a year
uh-huh
uh-huh
enthused and with it
our children thoroughly enjoy it
right
it 's been kind of nice
it started out when i was a youngster and watching my mother
now i 'm to the mother was
uh-huh
i am now the older generation and doing more of the cooking and watching my daughter more and everything
uh-huh
it 's something i really miss because i had twenty-seven first cousins
my word
we were very close family
our father 's generation was enough older than i
my father would be a hundred now that they 're all dead
uh-huh
in fact many of my first cousins are dead
are they
of course they have their own families and grandchildren and all that
we very rarely all of us get together
get together any more
we 're a long way away
the younger generation the next like my cousin 's children i do n't know very well
uh-huh
uh-huh
it
it 's
i doubt that that will come to be again
as long as my oldest aunt lived we we got together once a year
i do think now we have noticed a waning of interest
as parents get older and start dying off i think sometimes it is hard to keep the interest going
folks have gotten so mobile
i have a son and a daughter and two nephews that are grown and a brother who has a new marriage and a younger son
uh-huh
my brother and his wife live in nevada my daughter lives in colorado one of my nephews lives in new york city one nephew lives in memphis and my son lives here
uh-huh
i think it 's very unlikely we 'll have a family reunion
yeah
you probably do good just to get your immediate family together
yeah
i 'm divorced
really only immediate family i have left is my
i have a son and a daughter
uh-huh
uh-huh
my family 's really all dead
uh-huh
it was great pleasure while we did it
yeah
they 're a lot of fun
my si-
i have a sister
we have a son and a daughter
we have three grandchildren
uh-huh
our son and daughter are both married
our son 's not as interested in it as our daughter
our daughter is really interested
does it bother you if your children are not interested in it
i beg you pardon
does it bother you if your children are not interested in it
a little bit
i wish that our son was
uh-huh
the cousins are closer to our daughter 's age than to our son 's and just totally different interest group
plus
he 's newly married and does n't have children
uh-huh
i 'm hoping that as they are married a little bit longer and have children that they may be more inclined to want to go to it
uh-huh
i know that
what kinds of things do you do to try to get your children interested
just talk to them about it
talk to them about it and tell them some of the things we 're doing
when he was a preteen when he was like ten or twelve he loved going
uh-huh
he had another cousin he was close to and went
that cousin kind of quit going
as he got to be a teenager he was n't quite as interested
he was more interested in rock and roll
this is more country western group
uh-huh
just lack of interest
okay
what 's it been doing up there
it 's real dry up here
really
yeah
we need rain really bad
oh
all the farmers
th-
it 's good for hay
you know all the farmers got their first cut of hay and everything
they 're going to need some rain to get the second cut
oh
i 'm working for a lady who has a strawberry field
if we do n't have rain she 's going to lose a lot of money
my goodness
we have been drenched
oh
we have had so much rain for may and june that we 've got all the weather people down here really confused
my
we
it 's probably
it 's just
it 's usually dry down there is n't it
yeah
right now
by now it 's usually
no
it 's quit raining by at least a month
uh-huh
it 's still
we 're still having april showers for june
i hope they come this way
yeah
i do n't know where it came from
it 's been really
we got a lot of
we 're in central texas
it feels like we live in houston
really
yeah
it it
it rained today
it just kind of steamed everything up
uh-huh
it 's been great because we have n't had to use our sprinkler system
we 've had some with really really high winds that have trashed trees and everything else
my
it 's just
everyone up here with their gardens they 're not going to have much of a garden this year because it 's so dry
yeah
i hope you get some of that
yeah
we got enough
we have had plenty
we 're still forecast for more
really
yeah
gee
is california getting rain then
i 'm not real sure
i think a lot of this is coming out of
i think what 's happen- of
it 's coming out of canada
out of the gulf
it 's meeting what 's coming out of the gulf
oh
it 's just causing chaos
yeah
it 's been wet
uh-huh
we 've moved our yard i think three or four times in the last two or three weeks
my gosh
just because it just keeps growing and growing and growing
one week it just rained thunderstormed for a day straight
you could n't get out there
uh-huh
you just could n't get out there
by the time you finally got out there where your lawn mower would n't sink we were
yeah
lawn mower broke
now we need
we could use two days straight of rain
oh
it 's really drying up here
what always works for me is if i water my plants or we wash the car it usually rains
if not that night the next day
does it
i was telling everyone hang your clothes out on the line
it 's surely going to rain
yeah
yeah
whenever you hang your clothes out on the line it always rains
yeah
uh-huh
we 've had real hot weather
hotter than usual
yeah
yes
we
let me think
i got out of school in may
in march i was wearing shorts
wow
i was wearing shorts in march up at college
we w-
what they said is that this area has had its summer weather in the spring
is what they said what happened
i hope that
i do n't know
i hope that does n't mean we 're going to get an early winter
no
i would n't think so
i would n't
not as early as it came
your talking september maybe
yeah
that 's a little early
still the
uh-huh
yeah
i was wearing shorts in march
you know it was nippy
uh-huh
it was still in the seventies
yeah
high sixties low seventies in march
yeah
we were in new jersey last october
uh-huh
it was hotter there than it was here
yes
it was just like a heat wave
uh-huh
yeah
we have n't
we just died
my gosh
it was really hot i like it here
i would n't trade it for snow any day
really
yeah
i like the snow
i like to watch it fall
i just like it where it 's deep enough but not too deep
right
i can handle a vacation in it
my husband is from new jersey
he would n't go back either
he did all the shoveling and everything else
really
he said it was a pain
is n't it weird at christmas time without snow
no
i do n't think so
see last year we had snow at christmas time
oh
it was weird because we had snow
it 's like wow it actually fell on the right day
no
it 's not
in fact we 're used to running around in spring clothes in december
when it throws in a real cool winter we get broken pipes and all that kind of stuff because texas just is n't built for real cold weather for long periods of time
yeah
it 's real dry down there
you do n't have the humidity either do you
no
not were we are
now in houston and stuff they 've got it where no hairsprayer works
it 's so humid at times
here it 's just about right
it 's pretty dry and not too dry where it hurts to breathe we 're just about right
uh-huh
yeah
we 're just having all this rain
late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable
made the humidity real high
yeah
muggy huh
no
i like it
we 're right in a good stop because we get over the hundreds in the summer
uh-huh
it 's not it 's a dry heat
it 's not really as hot and muggy as it would be being over a hundred plus ninety percent humidity
yeah
that 's what 's bad up here is when we do get the real hundred and the high nineties we have the humidity to go with it
oh
you 're real mucky
you
your legs stick together just from walking
yeah
yeah
i know what
we like it where we 're at
if it 's not a whole bunch of everything at once type stuff
uh-huh
yeah
no
it 's interesting when it gets really cold here
people forget that they 're live in texas
they do n't know how to drive in snow i would n't trade it for anything
that 's good
i was born in texas
i visited other areas
i 'm just a sun person i think
i 've gotten used to it
i do n't know
i guess that 's really about all
yeah
weather is not real hard to talk about
it does n't last real long either
i thought the weather is the last thing you talk about
in this case it 's the only thing to talk about
michelle it 's great talking to
okay
i guess first of all i 'll just say we have n't done much gardening
we do lawn work all the time
our gardening we lost
remember the last two freezes
i do n't know how long you 've been here
yeah
i do
we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones
as far as our bushes we do n't have any
we do have some blackberry bushes they were really hearty and stayed on
really
we 've done really well with them
did you plant those yourself
uh-huh
yeah
oh
they 've been really good
the kids i had to
the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries
we go out
it 's hard to go out when it 's this hot
uh-huh
keep the weeds out of them and keep them off the ground so the ants do n't eat them
they 're okay
oh
yeah
that 's nice
i love blackberries
we
when i was smaller my family lived in tennessee
there used to be wild blackberries that we 'd go out and pick my brother and i
i do n't have any down here
yeah
yeah
we have some flowers that have
they 're just are real hearty also
they 're bold
they come up every year
they 're getting too thick
i need to go thin them out
i do n't know what kind of flowers they are
they 're real common around here
they 're orange
they look like a lily sort of
i think i know what they
i ca n't remember what the name of them are either
no
i think they 're real pretty when it rains because their petals do n't soak the rain in
they keep the rain on the outside little rain drops
oh
they look real pretty after the rain
i really like them
i need to get out and do that
as far as our grass it grows crazy here
it just keeps growing and growing
sometimes my son does it
it just is
i do n't know
i 've lived in utah my whole life
we ca n't seem to get ours green
i do n't know
down here the grass
yeah
i 'm
we 've had problems with our yard
we
it was one big weed is what it was
uh-huh
it was just horrible
my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns
we have this god awful ugly thing i know they must think i wish those people would do something about their yard
crappy i know
we have that too
my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff that seems to be helping
he put it on the front yard to see how it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard
uh-huh
we 've got a great dane in the back
uh-huh
she has eaten everything i have put out there
she 's eaten my crepe myrtle trees
dear
i know
she 's eaten the bushes
i 've tried to i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there
no
i barricaded it up so she could n't get into it
uh-huh
i went and took a shower and looked back out there
she was already in it
i was so mad
had somehow gotten in
i ca n't do anything back
yeah
yeah
i 've tried out in the front
like you said that freeze that came
uh-huh
i had some shrubs i put out front
it killed those too
i 'm just real discouraged with the whole thing
i just do n't even want to do anything
the other problem that we have
it 's funny because the two bushes on the ends of the house that i think are ugly they lived
i do n't know
yeah
that happened to us
we have these
i wanted to go out and kill them too
i know
they had no right to live
anyway under our trees we get a north sun
the
it looks like our trees do n't have any grass under them
i know
ours do n't
we just ca n't grow grass underneath there
i know
we ca n't either
i 've got two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard one on either side of the yard
uh-huh
they 're big
they 're real full and everything in the summer time
it 's killing everything underneath where the leaves are shading the tree
yeah
toward the end of the summer when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing
by then it 's so late then the winter comes and it stops
it 's it 's a never ending cycle
right
it 's a vicious cycle is n't it
yeah
it really is
it just really
we 've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and whatnot
i do n't
we 've never done anything like this
we 've been thinking if we built up a wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some flowers some new bushes in there that would live
uh-huh
i think that we 're going to try that
huh
i i think that 's pretty much what we have decided
i have two long windows
yeah
really
c-
i do n't really have to worry about that that much because my sons ' bedrooms are in the front
they 've got mini-blinds and stuff
yeah
only one is really in the flower bed part
the other one is out on the porch
yeah
there 's not really much i can do about that
that 's what our two rooms are on the front too with these long windows
one is a bedroom for our oldest son
one is an office that my husband and i work in
i really do n't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that
the flowers are out by the back of the house
that 's why the front room is
that 's not too bad
yeah
i like to look at the flowers
they 're pretty
i do too
that 's why i look at my neighbors yard
yeah
i do n't have anything to look at
i look at theirs
it 's funny because you try so hard i think sometimes to to do our yard
uh-huh
it 's like the wind blows everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them
yeah
even if you did get it under control it seems like in just a few months it would all be back
yeah
it 's really a pain
my husband works a lot
a lot
it 's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work
yeah
i 'm
it 's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard i really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it
uh-huh
i hate to mow the yard more than anything else
i hate to mow that yard
i know
it 's not my favorite thing in the world either
i 'm glad i have an old enough son to do it for me now
yeah
mine 's getting there
he helps
he does half
i do half
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
that is one chore that we will pay him for if he 'll go do the yard work out outside
sure i 'll be more then glad to pay him if he 'd just go out there and do it and do it to where i do n't have to go back out and redo it
right
exactly
that 's my only thing with him
exactly
that 's why i 'm having him help me now
i think you got it
okay
my first thoughts on capital punishment i-
i
the first thing i want to say is no just simply because we as human beings do n't have the right to take another human being 's life
uh-huh
we are punishing someone for taking someone 's life
in some cases we are punishing a person for taking someone 's life
in effect we are committing that same crime
it sounds like you have really strong views on it
uh-huh
i can see that point
i also have this
i question
i guess i can look at it both ways
just to play devil 's advocate it never seems right to me that we take in people that are criminals and people that are low income or even middle income that are struggling to provide for their families
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
our taxes are paying to feed and shelter those people
ac-
it just
that i find very difficult to swallow sometimes
uh-huh
one thing i do n't understand is the whole concept of death row
uh-huh
okay
these people are supposedly i guess waiting to die
right
i 'm with you there
okay
there are thousands upon thousands of people on death row
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'm not saying that
i guess i am kind of saying what are we doing
i guess that 's the same thing you were saying
what are we doing with these people
ha-
they 're there
we should take some kind of action take enough go a different route
right
exactly
they 're just
when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs we could be poor people and helping the environment
exactly
uh-huh
prison is such a waste of a human being
uh-huh
it does n't do anyone any good
exactly
yes
people need to be punished
uh-huh
i do agree with your statement that to take a human life is wrong
right
act-
locking someone up and not getting any benefit from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too
uh-huh
i guess i see both sides in that at the same time that i 'm saying that we 're committing the same crime
uh-huh
i also agree that if there is somebody out there that 's crazy and cruel enough to kill somebody or in some cases kill several people at one time
uh-huh
exactly w-
there was a case in dallas
i 'm sure they have n't gone to court yet
apparently two teenage boys held up a taco bell
they put four people in a freezer and shot them all
to me that is inhumane
for two people to be out in the world like that i do n't want them in my world
that 's right
you understand what i am saying
that 's right
i 'm i 'm not for killing anyone
uh-huh
i do n't want these people around at the same time
we want a safe environment for ourselves
we want to remove them
exactly
i think that the whole crux of the problem is no one has come up with a solution that is acceptable that does basically
uh-huh
right
i think that the whole idea of the death penalty was invented for two reasons
it removes them from society
right
you want to appease the people that have suffered
right
it really does n't take their pain away
uh-huh
at the same time like you said it drains society
uh-huh
it 's a
we
i think we should be
we
the same money that we 're using to build more prisons and make more prison space and keep these people in prison that same money or half of that money could be used towards rehabilitation programs of some sort
something to put these people back in society
right
prepare them first
exactly
that
the problem is so incredibly complex
i have a friend who works on the pardon and paroles
she interviews inmates all the time that are coming up for parole
uh-huh
uh-huh
she says it is just really frightening how easy it is to have the prisons release people because they 're overcrowded
exactly
these people have not benefited from the stay there
she says just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong
uh-huh
there 's not anything she can do to keep them in if they meet certain guidelines
uh-huh
right
those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work
it 's
uh-huh
you want people out of prison
you want people to get jobs and live happy lives
uh-huh
they ca n't just walk out of prison and do that
they ca n't just walk out of prison and say i 'm going to go a different route
that 's right
that 's right
there has to be some sort of buffer in there
uh-huh
some sort of program or
i know this costs money
it could n't cost any more money than we 're already spending
i know
i know
i would like to see the money that 's been budgeted for new prisons being put into the research of alternate solutions to the problem
uh-huh
how are we going to fix that tanya
how are we going to make that happen
how
what can we do
what power do we have
goodness
everyone 's trying to make it in their own little world
uh-huh
i 'm trying to make it with my job and make myself okay and make my family okay
that 's right
it 's so hard to try and be one of the movers and shakers i guess you would call them
really
i know
i know
uh-huh
it sounds like you are interested in what 's going on around you
uh-huh
yes
when you have a voice you do contribute
i guess that 's what we 're meant to do
right
maybe an opportunity will come by that we will have a chance to make a real change
uh-huh
i 'm a broadcast journalist
i feel like one day i probably will write a book or something
some of these views will be able to come out
where do you work
i work at channel six here
i 'm a news reporter
you do
that 's great
i guess i 'm pretty emotional about crime things like that now
i 've only been in it for a year
i get to see pretty much close up a lot of things that happen that people do n't see
uh-huh
i get to see a lot of crimes
exactly
i get to see people 's pain and things
when we talk about
uh-huh
most of us are so sheltered
yeah
a few people in the news that bring it to us and make us see what 's out there
exactly
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's
you 're really performing a benefit to society in doing that
a service
yeah
still we ca n't
i do n't know
i guess i would like to probably editorialize more
we have to just report what 's happening
we ca n't say this is what i think about the situation
uh-huh
uh-huh
sometimes you really want to say that
you really want to say what you think should be done or how you think this court case should have gone
that 's a
i 'm just i 'm just agreeing with you when i think of it how difficult it must be to just to just give the facts because usually on an issue that you really care about you want to persuade people to your viewpoint
uh-huh
you 're right
that has got to be a challenge sometimes
especially when you are dealing with a subject like capital punishment or something or abortion or something where there 's an no or yes side
right
you have your side
uh-huh
you have to report both sides
right
you really do n't want to because you have your side
you have to walk right down the middle with it
yeah
yeah
yeah
sometimes that 's hard
i 'm sure
that sounds interesting
i 'll read your book sometime
that 's good
all right
it was nice talking to you
i enjoyed it
okay
thanks for calling
okay
bye bye
okay
i 've pressed the button
okay
let me tell you
i have n't been too many places
you have n't been to too many places
no
no
i have n't
okay
i have been to hawaii

that is where i have always wanted to go
i have never been there
it is beautiful
i know
is it
i had an aunt that lived there
she could n't stand it any more
she moved out because she said the whole island was being taken over by the japanese
there is a lot of japanese over there
they are
yeah
she also told me that
not her necessarily other people that have been there have said that it is too commercialized
uh-huh
is it
yeah
there is
it is commercialized
yeah
sure
i do n't think i have enough
oahu naturally has got more people on it than the other islands
uh-huh
it is still beautiful
you have got to see at least once
i will
eventually
what is the nicest island
i like maui
maui
i think that is what usually people say they do like the best
yeah
i like it because the beach is nice and white
it is like oahu
you can go over there and lay on the beach
uh-huh
yeah
kauai
the beaches are nice
i do n't know just not nice as maui
yeah
where have you been

that is like a suburb or something whatever
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
okay

yeah
yeah
beautiful
yeah
we went to carmel
uh-huh
we took the eighteen mile drive
is n't that pretty
i love it down there
it is beautiful
that is really beautiful
uh-huh
my girlfriend was down there a few months ago
first time she has been down there
they wanted to take that drive
they had closed the whole road because of fog
the weather
yeah
they never got to do that
i have also been to the carribean
i have n't been there either
you name it i have n't been there
i have been there a couple of times
uh-huh
i went on a cruise
that is nice
the last time i went i went with my two sisters
uh-huh
it was over christmas time
yeah
we really had a good time
uh-huh
they had this cruise director dress up like santa claus
we went to the beach
they had put a christmas tree on the beach decorated it up
uh-huh
it was a lot of fun
that 's nice
is a cruise nicer than if you just go to a hotel
yeah
it is
i have heard it is
yeah
yeah
you do n't have to worry about unpacking or anything like that
you put your clothes in your room
uh-huh
you will have to go on one
you do n't get seasick
that is what i am afraid of
no
no
there was
some people did on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in
uh-huh
that is unusual
yeah
one of my sisters got sick
the other one did n't
uh-huh
it is really nice
they just do so many things for you to make you enjoy the trip and everything
right
yeah
you will have to do that once
i want to go on another one
i want to go to alaska
yes
someone i know was on a cruise to alaska
uh-huh
uh-huh
was it to alaska
yeah
i am pretty sure
that is right my hairdresser
really
she went last year
she said she went on a cruise
i was thinking cruise i am thinking
on
she is laying on the beach
i said you are not very tan for someone who has been on a cruise
she said we went to alaska
yeah
right
that i would like to go
hawaii is number one
i would also like to go to australia
get a
i think i would like to too
yeah
i keep hoping to win the lottery where i can do all these things
i am just in the publisher 's clearing house and the reader 's digest because we do n't { f uh
} right now the lottery here
tell me about changes from say twenty years ago since you were an adult twenty years ago
let 's see we assume i was an adult twenty years ago
you 're able to you 're able to vote and go to war and things like that
yeah
definitely able to go to war twenty years ago but not vote
that 's right
that 's one of the changes
not vote
that was one of the changes that came about in the last twenty years
yeah
twenty years ago is nineteen seventy
nineteen seventy i had been married two years
uh-huh
we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixty-eight
uh-huh
around here on the east coast we were heavy into affirmative action
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
the problem was that my hair was too long
uh-huh
you were n't allowed to have a mustache or a beard if you wanted to get ahead with the company
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
if you were a black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months
if you were white male you 're talking six years
huh
that 's basically where i ended up
uh-huh
uh-huh
is the company now well represented demographically at the higher echelons
did it work
i think so
i i i stopped working for them in seventy-eight seventy-nine
uh-huh
it 's
i think they 're like all companies well represented
uh-huh
everything seems to be fine
uh-huh
i 've kind of lost touch with the company
we had a falling out
uh-huh
uh-huh
as far as their management goes i 'm not sure they 're any better off than they were before management wise
uh-huh
other changes just people seem to be more outspoken now individually rather than collectively
uh-huh
back in the seventies we had a lot of protests against the war and bring our troops home
things were more organized
uh-huh
i 've noticed that now more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i 'm not sure if that was because eighties was the me decade
the me decade
uh-huh
everybody was into me
we are getting back into us
it it 's
i 've seen a great deal of change as far as corporate responsibility and things
uh-huh
uh-huh
people 's response to that at first not trusting and now expecting more
uh-huh
uh-huh
what about the last ten years that you 've been aware
that i 've been aware of i 've
at least in my own circles i 've been aware of an increasing from my generation
i do n't know if i can quite call myself a distinct generation from you
half generation off i guess
i 've noticed a certain increase pessimism with america no longer being sort of on top
i had the impression
there was the quote unquote losing of the vietnam war which was a blow
it was right around that time when i started becoming a socially conscious adult
i realize that people of my age have no major success in the sense that you saw the passage of the civil rights act and major social change in that sense
i
all the changes that have happened in the last even during my adulthood have been more incremental
they 've been continual perhaps and good gains have been made
there has n't been the same sort of fiery speeches of martin luther king or whatever that has really galvanized the population
there 's just
instead there 's been sort of an increasing i do n't know japan bashing and things like that
uh-huh
a lot of
i see among some of my friends and even more among some of my students who are maybe twenty a real sense of america 's losing it
yes
losing it in the competitive market
a real knowl-
a lack of understanding how that could be in the sense that how could america have gone from being number one to possibly being number two
to
our former enemies and things like that
i see a lot of pessimism growing
at the same time i think there 's there 's a growing environmentalist movement and sense of corporate respon- increased corporate responsible towards environmental safety and things like that
that might potentially be sort of the civil right the equivalent of the civil rights act in the near future in terms of some real landmark bills passing and things like that
such that people
the thing about civil rights is people take it for granted now
my generation ca n't rest on the glow of having achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that there 's still some racism
basically things are
the assumption things are basically kind of taken care of
there 's a notion of fairness
yes
that 's
while still far from perfect is much more established i think
even i think along the line of the goals of civil rights there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone
uh-huh
of course
it 's human nature
do n't like the way you look do n't like the way you dress do n't like your hair do n't like it 's just something that always sets people off
you like someone you do n't like someone you 're just completely indifferent
yeah
yeah
the problem is that ideally the world would like you to be completely indifferent
i i understand what you say about the environmental movement
it 's been a long time coming
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i just
i 've seen a lot of changes from the original earth day
uh-huh
i 'm heavily involved in my own personal recycling
we recycle paper and cans here at work
uh-huh
uh-huh
i do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and all that stuff at home
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'm starting to see more and more recycling centers cropping up all over the place here on the east coast
uh-huh
right
that 's a real change except it sort of brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything else
yeah
like
all this recycling used to be in tact * [ [ typo in tact should be 'intact ' or not all of it
yeah
much of it did
recycling was a wartime thing
they turned around and called them junkyards and started making profits off them after the war
yes
yes
now we got to the point where the junkyards you 've got to pay them to take something there
uh-huh
things have really changed a lot
i think the other part about america 's decline i think has to do with
a perceived decline anyway yeah
yeah
the perceived decline has to do with the attitudes and the educational system
in i have three children in school right now
i 'm not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them
i had
when i was down in dallas for two years i had my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong and words spelled wrong not marked as such
uh-huh
yeah
this person 's teaching my children
uh-huh
i had a real problem with that
yeah
i 'd say as someone who 's involved in education i 'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society
relative pay which is a major way we value people has been poorer and poorer over the years
that
there 's been cost of living increases
not quite in proportion to cost of living
it 's just more and more a real low income sort of job and very low prestige
there 's that old saying those who can do it and those who ca n't teach
this is the way of let 's make fun of the teachers those are the people who ca n't do anything
yeah
if you have that kind of social attitude it 's hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay work for low social prestige just because they care about good education
yeah
you get more and more people and up there because it 's the safety net of those of average intelligence or something they can always teach
i 'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in maryland
they 're trying to get a a merit system here in maryland rather than a tenure system
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for puerto rico
i was a resident although very young of what is now the state of alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when alaska stopped being a territory and became a state
i guess i have a left over positive feeling about the question even though i do n't know very much about puerto rico
i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in alaska have been very positive
i have a suspicion that i believe that the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of puerto rico one ought to make it a full-fledged state let it go one or the other
what is your situation
i guess i do n't have such close experience with an area becoming a state as you do
my concern is the economy because as i understand it puerto rico has a very low standard of living or at least annual average income
part of this i suppose is justified in that the climate they do n't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need
however in that case i guess i would favor status quo
i have been to puerto rico and found it very very interesting
i did peace corps training there
that 's very interesting
i saw it also as a young student
it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in california
the spanish was no problem
it was very lovely
the people seemed very friendly and nice
i have
i work with a girl from puerto rico
i guess i have never thought to ask her what she favors
your concern on the economy was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on puerto rico or pressures on the u s in terms of aid
probably more in terms of the u s
i 'm not quite sure how the u s copes with this sort of thing
i 've live abroad most of my life
i guess i 've been very cut off
i lived actually in lebanon
i was very cut off from the press as i was becoming an adult
i do n't know how the u s would cope with a new state that is so very very poor
uh-huh
i guess we 'd have a lot of aid if you consider the inner cities of new york and how much aid it needs
i suppose the whole new state would require such aid
i guess we 're assuming that puerto rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than mississippi
i think so
okay
that 's something that i guess i have not much of an image of other than puerto rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess
although i 'm aware of the political problems and unrest and also difficulties they have i do n't know whether statehood would improve their economy
i do n't know that the act of being a state would have any impact on them
i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they do n't have now
of course if their economy is weak there is not much of a base on which to tax
i do n't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being since they are n't a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they are n't able to tax like a typical state would be
how do you feel though about
i guess it 's to their advantage to be a territory
i wonder how having been in a territory but only as a young student
my parents were in the military at the time
they did n't have ready negative feelings about being in alaska at the time since they voted absentee
i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a feeling of second class citizenry to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote
the district of columbia people for instance are quite frustrated i think at times in their not having a senate representative
uh-huh
yeah
those are good points which obviously i had never thought about
i do n't know i suppose they also not being a state are probably freer to determine their own ways of life than they would if
i 'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory
uh-huh
i see what you mean
that
yeah
taxes would undoubtedly be occurring
there
i do n't know i do n't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation
frequently the laws in a territory are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states
i
i 'm thinking in terms of education
then again each state sets its own
i do n't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like puerto rico
it 's interesting because i have n't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to economy i had thought of it more in terms of political realization
i guess i had automatically made the assumption that anyone would rather be a state of the u s than an independent country
uh-huh
i thin-
one one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they 've recently voted that spanish is the official language which i always assumed it was anyway
if they 've just taken such action it would seem to indicate to me they 're doing it because they 're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state maybe because they do n't want to become a state for fear of losing the spanish or hispanic heritage
uh-huh
that 's interesting too
it sounds as though you are in favor of status quo
i believe i would probably tend towards that
i think having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these
[ i 'm ul- i guess i 'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point towards the statehood
that 's interesting
right
what about if they demanded to have spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood
i think i would be troubled
i believe that any of our states
i
constitutionally i do n't think there are any prescriptions against that decision even if louisiana chose to go with creole or something
i do n't think there is any prohibitions
i would be bothered by that
i 'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of america 's strengths
that 's the the melting pot
uh-huh
i am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines
i 'm troubled by too close a clinging to the past
i 'm also realizing that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country
uh-huh
canada i guess comes to my mind as they 're going through the throes up there relative to french quebec and whatever
that i think that would be a negative step to make
i think that that they would need to reassess that
i 'm troubled even in by bilingualism in so far that it gets in the way of of the melting pot aspect
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's interesting because although i tend to be bilingual spanish based on experience i was in bilingual education in california
i did n't have any problem with my students
i noticed my brother who was quite a bit younger was learning spanish in elementary school
he ca n't speak a word
obviously it did n't work in california
yeah
i 'm rather in favor of people being bilingual
right
i 'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn english and a second language
right
i 'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level
i see
i 'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think we have gone to time
i appreciate your having called
okay
thank you very much
good-bye
bye
bye
what kind of house do you live in
we live in a one story just like a style home the standard texas fox and jacobs
yeah with a yard and fence
how about you guys
are you in a apartment or a home
i 'm in an apartment in plano
they say those are difficult to find
yeah
they are if
kind of depends on what you 're looking for
mine 's just a one bedroom place
that 's
how are rents doing
i have n't looked at rents in a long time
it 's hard for me to tell because i have n't rented in probably twenty twenty-five years
uh-huh
just
i 'm getting back into apartment life
it 's
what 's a one bedroom
are you in a
yeah
plano
most complexes in plano are pretty nice
you 're probably in a
they vary from place to place
it 's hard to tell how well they 've been kept up how old they are
uh-huh that does get high
these are probably one of the nicest that i found
they 're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place
yeah
yeah
it does considering that house payments are not a whole lot more than that
yeah
i was going to say our mortgage is between depending on
it drops
seems like in the last six months we got lucky
we refinanced
it
it was like eight hundred and something
it went down to like seven hundred and twenty
yeah
that 's really not
i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a town house in
that 's a lot for a townhouse
yeah
in
they 're near plano in north dallas too
i could n't believe it
that 's what happens when you get up in this area you got all these companies are up here
these
yeah
i guess they know they 're going to get it
i think that nobody was really buying houses there for a long time there because of just
we 've been in ours for about ten years
there 's no investment in it all it allows you to do is itemize on your taxes yeah
yeah
yeah
that 's true
you just take off your mortgage interest
that 's about it
that 's really about it
it 's
have you ever owned your own home
yeah
i 've owned several built several
you know what it 's like
yeah
it 's like when you first
this is our third one
it 's not
it 's not that exciting after a while
especially around north dallas or at least in plano area they basically all look alike because fox and jacobs
yeah
suburban tract
yeah
we lived out of state for a while and came back
we lived in a smaller city
now we say dallas really is big and polluted
is n't it
i can remember
i 've only been here eight years
i can remember coming to work from
i used to live in wylie
uh-huh
i could see downtown dallas
now there 's this brown haze over it it 's moving north
yeah it 's really sad because they 're not doing anything
we 're getting off the subject i guess
just like with housing they 're not doing anything about pollution
they 're not doing anything about
it 's going to look like
have you ever been to houston
yeah
i used to think that dallas was better than houston because their zoning for where you can put a house next to a
yeah
now it looks just like houston to me
yeah
it does
how long have you been in this house
we 've been in here ten years
ten years
yeah
we 've got some investment in it
you really do n't get anything out of it
no
you really do n't
you said you were out of state for a while was that a smaller town than dallas area
yeah
smaller
we were up in pittsburgh pennsylvania
how was it
my home town
how were the house prices up there
the prices a lot better because pittsburgh is about the size like a louisville or minneapolis that type of size
yeah
the prices what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy-five eighty
wow
yeah
it 's really
we did n't think it was that clean
after you 're gone for a while it looks cleaner
yeah
a lot of these people that i 've talked to that are coming down from what i call the back east especially from j c penney are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy-five thousand dollar houses down here
yeah
they 've wound up getting better houses here than they had there
in a way i guess it works both ways
i guess it 's
yeah
here i guess it depends on what you want
here i got a lot of people that work for j c penney in marketing
yeah
a lot of the people that came from that area probably like what you 're talking about they had a lot of property but not a lot of house
now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it
that 's a fact
they love it
they they think they 're getting
you say sun room to them and you enclose and you can sell it
i guess that 's true
yeah
they do n't have to worry about yard upkeep if they do n't hardly have any
yeah
a lot of them i know a couple women that work there
they do n't miss in public relations
they do n't miss having a basement to run up and down to
that 's true
not too many basements in texas
i said you have n't heard about tornados
how about those
yeah
i remember when i was little we did n't have a
i grew up in southern oklahoma
uh-huh
people across the street had a cellar
we never did
it 's just like dallas area it was tornado alley up there
every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street
we 'd go into the cellar
i to this day i do n't care if i go or not
yep
if it 's going to get me it 's get me
that 's exactly
growing
i grew up in western pennsylvania near pittsburgh
we used to call the basements actual cellars
it 's funny to hear that word because i never hear it
it 's like the back porch used to be a stoop
yeah
the housing is just
we like the older houses
i do n't know if we 're going to stay here or not depends
you ever thought about building a house
pardon me
have you ever thought about building a house
yeah
when we were up north
some family things changed
we ended up come back down here and all that because it helped my husband 's work
we really would like to
we do n't know if we 're going to do it unless we stay here
yeah
that 's true
especially when
with t i it 's like anybody else you never know how long you 're going to be in one place
yeah
it 's real tough
the economy any more
i think everybody just lives under an umbrella the uncertainty with housing and everything
yeah
it 's
do you work
pardon me
do you work
yes
i do
how do you handle
do you have kids
no
we do n't
you got
he 's working and working to get this big house to take care of
how do you manage both of those
how do we take care of the house
i do n't have a mexi-
i should n't say that
i do n't have an ethnic maid
yeah
i do n't have
we have some friends that live near north dallas off of campbell road
they have like a four thousand square foot home
she 's got a live out nanny
any rate i do n't have any of that
i do n't know
it 's really not too difficult with no children and just two people
you basically can take care of everything yourself
we have a
yeah
we have a dog
we 're pretty
we 're not fanatically neat
we keep things up not like where there is three feet of weeds or anything in the yard by the time you need to get around to fertilizing and cutting in the spring
yeah
yeah
what about home repairs and stuff
do you have to do all that yourself
no
we 're pretty much
we 've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wall paper together and things like that
you too
we pretty much hire
we subcontract mostly everything other than anything that 's not a
yeah
i know how to fix a running toilet
yeah
he does what he needs to
mostly if it 's something major cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that we just hire out to do that
sounds like you 've already got the makings for being a general contractor
yeah
no thanks
i
if you do n't wall paper it well together you should probably not build a house together
have you ever done that
yeah
i built three houses in my life
how 'd that go
the building process was a lot of fun
uh-huh
puts a lot of strain on things
getting to agree to things i 'm sure
i also think that once you get to be certain
when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older you start
yeah
the dollar value on things i
you bet
i think people that own homes a lot in north dallas are very materialistic
you bet
i know i 'm supposed to talk about homes
the people that own them are the homes themselves
spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies for custom drapes just does n't
yeah
to some of them i guess it does n't matter that maybe they 've got enough coming in to take care of it
yeah
that 's
you see a lot of these people that came west from new york with exxon or j c penney
it 's just a hoot to watch them
are they
as far as they 're concerned they 've come to the promised land
they 've got it made
right
right
exactly
was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house
yeah
you 're confined by space
i had a
i came out of a thirty-one hundred square foot two story house
my goodness
yeah
i had room for everything
in fact i had more room than knew what to do with
i do n't know
uh-huh
just seems like stuff always expands to fill available space
yeah
in a way you can travel light
you can
you lear- you adjust you figure out
how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that
it 's not as bad as i thought it was
uh-huh
it 's not as bad as i remembered especially going to college and living in apartments there you know how noisy that can be
yes
i do
there seems to be more a mature crowd in apartments at least where i am even though there 's kids all around
there 's traffic
there 's people running up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that
still
everybody pretty much keeps- keeps to their own turf so to speak
yeah
pretty much
there 's never really any
i remember in school
there 's just
seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night
yeah
you do n't run into that up here i think because there 's so many professional people if you want to call them that that go spend all day at work
uh-huh
they want to come home
they want some quiet
relax and try to go to sleep
really
yeah
you see a lot of activity outside people riding bikes playing ball or jogging
they 're doing this and that
they 're trying to unwind
i think plano in general is getting a little more
it 's gotten so big it 's almost a town in it 's own right
yeah
it 's a hundred and what eighty thousand something like that
something
yeah
the price of home
we paid about seventy-eight nine for our house like i said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago
i 'd say they appraised it
gone up maybe like five percent
yeah
it 's an investment
it 's something that
when you 're first married or starting out you think if you really have something
you really
it 's just real
nowadays with the way the income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize
you bet
the thing that gets me is you never really catch up you never really finish doing things you 're always paying for something
yeah
exactly
we
yeah
even
we had i called them prefabs just a tract home
we had one of their homes that was nicer in pennsylvania
it was an older home
you buy an older home and you 're always fixing things up
you are constantly
there 's always something going wrong
okay
great
currently i 'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program
huh-uh
i 'm mainly do a lot of walking
i have a son that 's a little bit overweight
the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around
my wife and i kind of take turns
at one time i had a fairly regular exercise program
in the last couple of months i 've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down
all this space that normally would be dedicated towards the exercise area is covered in boxes
yeah
what did you do when you did exercise regularly
i had a little routine that i did for warm ups
huh-uh
i did some very mild light weight lifting
nothing
i 'm not trying to make big bulging muscles just trying to try and stay as firm as i can stay in my old age
huh-uh
yeah
right now i try when it 's nice out
it 's been raining a lot this spring
i try to
i have a bicycle
i like to cycle a lot
my husband and i we have entered a few rallies that 's pretty popular in texas
i do n't know if it 's up north
huh-uh
every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally
thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles which that 's a lot of fun
huh-uh
we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that
t i where i work has a fitness center
a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends we 'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill
they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine that are fun to ride and workout on
i try to
i 'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis
i used to get into it and get out of it based on my schedule
i 'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now
it 's a big commitment
we do n't have any kids yet
that 's a part of it
yeah
that 's a plus
i have a total of five children
i have three left living at home
huh-uh
they do take up a big part of my evening and weekend
yeah
it 's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself too
yeah
it 's something they do n't tell you about when you 're growing up
when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children
huh-uh
that 's why at t i they really stress staying in shape stay in overall fitness no smoking and all that
it 's hard to find an actual exercise regimen that work for you because i know a lot of people that cycle they take their kids behind them on the bikes
i do n't know if that would work for me because i do n't know i would n't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain
it 's really hard to find something that works and to find time to do it and stay committed to it three days a week or whatever
i think maybe walking or running would probably work because it does n't take much time and much money or whatever
yeah
yeah
you have to
what i found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself
huh-uh
you can use what ever rationale you want
basically the healthier you stay the longer you 'll live
right
if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer then i 'll around a lot longer
those people that i 'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now get the enjoyment of me years past where i would have been if i would n't have taken it
huh-uh
if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine
yeah
i 've been learning a lot lately about
i 've been reading a book by kenneth cooper
i do n't know if you 're familiar with him
huh-uh
he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health
he 's kind of he 's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing
he was talking about the three things that cause aging smoking are inactivity * [ [ mistranscribed listen
what was the other one i think was obesity
if you can control those three areas then are you going to live longer cause those are risk factors it 's kind of a tip
yeah
i 've done a lot of study over the years
i found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water
really
yeah
the research that i 've done
i 've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three
huh-uh
it 's amazing that prior to nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks
huh-uh
there were none prior to nineteen-hundred
in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities
after that we started having the hearts attacks
dr price wrote a book coronary cholesterol and chlorine
you can usually find it in a health food store
huh-uh
i know they had it in health food stores in plano
i used live in plano
dr price
dr price
yeah
it 's amazing
he makes the
it 's a very small book
the guys very opinionated
he makes a very good case against chlorine
there were no heart attacks before we started using it
he points out that people in england
even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we 're ingesting now
they were n't dropping dead of heart attacks
yeah
he did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours and proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis which is the clogging of the arteries
huh-uh
yeah
he 's
there 's been a lot of reports since then
this whole thing about
first it was stress then it went to cholesterol
now they 're saying what 's cholesterol
there 's good cholesterol and there 's bad cholesterol
huh-uh
it 's amazing what he points out in that book
in fact everyone there was a toxicologist for the environmental protection agency who did work back in nineteen eighty-six who wrote a letter to dr price in nineteen eighty-seven in this letter he praised dr price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that e p a had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis
e p a never published that report
what 's the name of this book again
coronary cholesterol and chlorine
i 'll have to remember that
yeah
that will be very interesting
my husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon
he 's really interested in the heart
yeah
in fact he 's a heart too
he 's done a lot of research on how your heart reacts to exercise
sorry
he made me laugh
yeah
there is a lot of good information out there about health
a lot of the myths they 've been passing around people are starting to realize are n't true
yeah
i 'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that because that 's good for you
huh-uh
to believe some of the things
i do n't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet
to think that solely alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is just hard to believe
if you get a chance read dr cooper 's book on controlling cholesterol
huh-uh
that 's a real good
he talks about that
talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that
yeah
i actually eat pretty much anything that i want
huh-uh
i 've had my cholesterol checked a few times
i 've never been above one-hundred and fifty never
huh-uh
i
you have a good ratio of good to bad cholesterol
everything is within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing
they leave themselves wide open so they ca n't be sued
yeah
we 've
i work at the t i site in hunt valley maryland
really
yeah
we 've had a few of the health fairs up here
i 've always come out aces
that 's good
i 'm not really that big on watching what i eat
i do eat some health cookies that are high in fiber low in fat and all that kind of stuff
yeah
i mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine i 'm not worried about it
i personally do n't have any problem with drug testing employees or potential employees do you
basically
basically no
okay
i do n't
i really ca n't disagree with it
i
the policy that t i has i think is very fair
uh-huh
i
they first had a policy where they would test new employees
since i 've been with them the last four years there 's been in the last year year and a half they 're doing random testing of all employees
uh-huh
i think that 's really the only fair way to do it
yes
i really think it ought to be s-
junkins all the way down
it is
it
from what i understand it is jerry junkins all the way down
right
as a matter of fact i want to think they took the top managers first
is n't that a fact
i 've been retired from t i about a year
uh-huh
the program was still fairly new
i guess it had been going on maybe almost a year before i retired
uh-huh
i was not ever called upon to do a drug test
i certainly would n't object to it
i think random is probably the only really fair way to do it
yeah
i like it because
i i grew up in the sixties i saw
uh-huh
uh-huh
i know my friends who were druggies and friends who were n't i think it 's a real problem
uh-huh
uh-huh
i
absolutely
i think it 's causing us a lot of trouble and a lot of problems
yeah
uh-huh
i 'm hoping that a lot of other companies will follow the same path
i do n't think they 'll have much choice do you
probably not
especially if they have anything do with government contracts or anything
as matter of fact i want to believe that the defense department more or less mandated that people who work on defense contracts do some sort of drug testing
uh-huh
i think that 's really what maybe prompted t i to do it
i was in the defense electronic division when i retired
i know it was a real hot hot item there
i want to think maybe they really got some nudging from d o d to do this sort of thing
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
you know the atmosphere then
yep
yeah
very aware of it like school systems and that kind of thing
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
i agree
i
i 'd like to know that my child 's being taught by a teacher who 's not on drugs or who might be at a point where they 're trying to sell my kid drugs
that 's right
that 's r-
absolutely
yeah
i d-
i just ca n't disagree the basic premise
yeah
it 's to m-
as far as i know it 's seems to be a fairly accurate program as far as the testing goes
i like the idea that they have a system where they allow you to be retested if for some reason there may have been a problem or something did show up
that 's right
that 's right
offer you help if you need help
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
rather than just put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself
yeah
that 's right
that 's not going to help anybody get over the problem
no
ab-
i believe it is a a medical problem
that 's right
of course i also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world too
absolutely
not to mention alcohol
yeah
there 's a lot of things out there
yep
yep
i 'm just glad that they decided not to tax drugs otherwise they 'd be legal
uh-huh
they 'd be getting tax money off it the same way they are the alcohol and tobacco
that 's right
that 's right
gosh
it 's a real problem
i 'm sure
i 'm sure
yeah
i have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy and stuff
uh-huh
i moved to a t i facility that had never had random drug sampling before because they were outside of the military sector
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
it was an industrial company that t i purchased
the people here a lot of them are real opposed to it
yeah
uh-huh
they were really opposed to it
uh-huh
there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs
uh-huh
that 's why they were opposed to it
right
it resulted in a few people leaving because they just flat out were n't going to put up with the policy
uh-huh
uh-huh
they had a life-style
they were n't going to change it
yeah
right
it 's
yeah
i know a lot of people who when it first be-
at least began was in the talking sta-
everybody knew it was coming
it just a matter of time everybody was screaming invasion of privacy and all this stuff
a lot of people i think after they thought about it for awhile weighed the pros and cons decided it 's really not a bad idea unless you 're doing drugs of course
yeah
you should have no objection to it
it 's like going down to get your license and checking your eyes
that 's right
why do i need my eyes checked
uh-huh
that 's right
yep
yep
you know it 's why are we doing this
so you do n't kill people on the road
that 's right
or yourself
it 's a ba-
it 's the basic premise with drug testing
yeah
that 's right
especially some of the jobs
luckily i 've always been in the engineering sector
uh-huh
it 's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as hurting someone
uh-huh
it 's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it
yeah
that 's true
in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor and down in some of those labs and stuff if i 'd want somebody down there that i 'm working with side by side that could kill me by doing something incorrectly because they were not exactly all there because they were on drugs
uh-huh
yeah
assembly people
that 's right
that 's r-
absolutely
there 's a lot of sectors where i think that would would help out
i think in the long run we all benefit
uh-huh
absolutely
yeah
if you have
if you 're not working with someone on drugs then you 're going to have less accidents
uh-huh
you have less accidents
you spend less money on medical
uh-huh
you spend less money on medical then the company 's more profitable
yeah
the company 's more profitable then maybe they can pay you more
sure
if they can pay you more you can buy more
uh-huh
it
it goes around to everywhere
sure
trickles up and down
yep
all over
sure does
yeah
affects a lot of people
it certainly does
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
and and start it up
i think they probably will
if they
i 'm sure it 's a very expensive program to administer
i 'm not sure every small company could do it
a lot of companies are coming down in price
uh-huh
i think that the insurance companies are starting to give benefits
uh-huh
reduction in medical costs if they
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
it 's got to help them too
yeah
i think everybody will benefit from the program
uh-huh
yeah
i do too
that 's right
i think if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say if you impose mandatory drug testing we 'll reduce your insurance costs by twenty per cent
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
of course the company 's not going to reduce the employee 's cost of insurance twenty per cent they 're going to reduce their own
no
no
it 'll save in some areas
yeah
right
yeah
that 'll cover it
maybe some insurance companies might start offering it as part of the package
that 's right
that certainly could happen
that 's a very very very competitive business
yeah
it
i think i think all around it 's going to help out a lot
yeah
i do too
course
i just really ca n't disagree with you
yeah
okay
it 's nice to talk to you
it was great talking with you
you take care
you do the same
okay
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
we can be recorded while we talk about it
okay
is your
does your city have mandatory recycling
no
we do n't have mandatory
we 're kind of slow up here
we 've just started doing recycling probably last summer
it 's all voluntary
that 's interesting
cities have a mandatory recycling
there 're some places that are strongly encouraging it
that they city will pick it up
that 's been one of the arguments here
i 'm just sitting here looking we 've got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff
we have to carry it some distance
some places you can sell your recyclables
for example our church was collecting newspapers
yeah
when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing
we got like a penny a pound for them
it turns out that so much
the problem in texas is that they 've got so much paper now from people recycling that they 've got no way to reprocess it
my
it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it
the value has gone down
it turns out it was n't worth for the church to do
i did n't realize
you would think
now up here i suppose they send it all back to the mill
there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of
there is one in northern vermont
there 's probably a paper mill that 's sixty miles from here
i did n't think that
in the large city that if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away it 's a lot of money to transport
yeah
that 's
in dallas there no plan to build
i think there 's some in east texas there 's some pulp mills
you have to go to houston
it 's interesting
there 's places that will buy metal
they still buy aluminum can and likes that * [ [ can > cans likes > like
do you have to buy metal
copper is a very good one to collect
even aluminum
yeah
do you do recycling
we do the recycling
our city will pick up our recyclables
oh
they have these little blue bins
i do n't recycle personally
i 'm saying i want to do it
i do n't get a lot of magazines
i do n't get a
i do n't buy the newspaper
i do have a lot of
my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of different papers and cardboards
do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans
yes
we have a bottle return
a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles
we 've had five cent deposits on our bottles for years
it 's worth taking them back
we do n't have
we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles
they should definitely get the nickel returnable
it 's great for the kids because
a lot of the kids get the money from it
it 's great for the boy scouts running around they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes
that 's it
you 'll
there is a down side to all this about no good deed going unpunished that my mother sells trees that they make paper out of
every time i recycle newspapers in fact there 's a
kimberly and clark the makers of kleenex and such has a big paper mill
yeah
in fact i almost went to work for them
i was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me
it 's twenty or thirty miles from my house
every time you recycle that 's one less tree my mother can sell
it 's a question should i be diligent and and recycle and put my mother out of her livelihood
and recycle
yes
i see that
it 's an interesting point though that everybody 's so anxious to recycle
i suppose it does provide some gainful employment
it takes away employment from the resource
its
in general i think it 's a good idea because like the glass you ca n't argue that the glass
i do too
it does n't biodegrade and the plastics obviously
they do n't either
we might as well recycle those
yeah
like i say it 's not a very controversial thing
everyone thinks we should do it
it 's just that we 're so lazy
personally i do n't want to clean my
i just have can cat food
i do n't want to clean the can and take the label off it and put it in a separate bin
yeah
i 'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash
that 's what we 've got
we started about new year 's we decided we 'd get ambitious
we took one load over there
now we 've got these containers filling up with stuff
it 's not a very high priority thing to go haul these containers over there
yeah
i think i would be like
when i bring my bottles back if they 're pretty clean and stuff so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months
i get a whole bunch of them and bring them over
if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean like if i washed all the cans and things i would n't mind if it sat around too much
if it stunk or something i would n't like doing it
i produce quite a bit of trash
my house
i see it
i do n't see so much that i can recycle
yeah
like i say it 's a lot of different type paper and cardboard
i 'm not a real plastic person user but a lot of paper pretty much
i do n't know how they sort that
if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles i would think that i would have a recycling center
now it 's just me and my husband
i do n't know
every little bit helps
right
yeah
i know what you 're saying
we have a very aggressive recycling at work
i 'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin
some people the recycle bin is on their way out
instead of carrying your newspapers when they get done with them at the end of the day they throw them in the trash
do you have separate trash cans at your desk
no
we do n't
other offices do
they have a box for papers
we have one that 's recyclable and then for lunch sacks and waste food
they gave us a list of things that are n't re-
it turns out it 's not so bad
i get a lot of reports that are covered in plastic or like saran wrap or something { d anyway
} cardboard there 's a few
it 's interesting that we 're recycling computer type paper
yeah
one day they 'll pick up
the cleaning people come through and they 'll pick up recycled paper
the next day they 'll pick up the other
oh
depending on how much
there 's a lot of it works pretty well
we have a waste cans for aluminum in the break areas at work
that 's a really good idea because our fruit juices for some reason when they 're in a can do n't come with a deposit
yeah
they 're thinking about putting a deposit on them because you 're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans where they 're so much easier just to put a deposit on it because probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because they 're beer and soda
yeah
when they sell juice it 's some strange quirk in the law you do n't have to have a deposit on it
even like a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it
if it 's got soda in it it does
it 's a strange
that 's an interesting distinction
yeah
they should clear that up
it would n't take them much to put a stamp on the juice cans as easily as the soda
yeah
redemption centers are a big thing up here
they get a penny a can they handle
they give you five cents when they return the can to the distributor
i think they get a penny two pennies a can
those of us that do n't have state income taxes
yet that 's the big debate here in texas that the legislature wants to put one in
yeah
it 's interesting what people get upset about
it really is
is bottle return down there a heated debate
no
yeah
we
here you ca n't drink
we 're not civilized now you can not drink beer and drive it was actually legal
yes
i know i was in atlanta
you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand
here let me put that in a paper cup for you
that was strange
i think
if some people they have
they say we 're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all the recycle center you have to deal with the can and then you have to recycle it
their problem 's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits see how they handle it
yeah the other thing is it also is a is a good habit to just to conserve resources because you get in the habit of that you think in terms of of of things like saving
see if it 's a good way
do it that way because like i say people are making money on it
the cans are worth something
are we tonight
yeah
sure
okay
let me go ahead and press one
okay leslie
i 'd like to find out a little bit about your hobbies
what do you like to do in your spare time
when i have my spare time i do enjoy
it 's a cherished commodity now days
that 's right
i do enjoy sewing
i hand
i do some needlepoint
great
i 've been doing a a picture for my father-in-law
if i ever get enough spare time he might see it one day
uh-huh
some other things i like to do are music and also reading
what kind of music
i enjoy singing
okay
yeah
great
i enjoy music too
i
one thing that i like to do is sit down and play the piano
i ca n't play that well
i enjoy that
uh-huh
a couple of hobbies that i also have is
i really enjoy bike riding
the biggest hobbies i have right now are my kids and whatever they are involved in
yes
like my oldest boy is involved in soccer
we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football
we also like to ride bicycles
we 're riding bicycles
a lot of the hobbies that i have right now are centered around my children and also things that my wife and i like to do together
uh-huh
personally a lot of the hobbies i had when i was growing up and going to college and so forth are having to change
uh-huh
i really enjoyed mountain climbing
i really enjoyed skiing and a lot of outdoor activities
there 's not a whole lot of mountains here in texas that i can go skiing with that right now
that 's right
hopefully i will be able to get back to the slopes some day
yeah
i have not had the opportunity to go skiing
i grew up in arizona which has some mountains around it never did get out and ski
uh-huh
you did n't
no
i never did
i guess i did n't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing
of course i was at that stage of my life where i had to be taken to places
i could n't go by myself
yeah
that 's true
that 's true
of course once i got to the age where i could have done it myself i had other interests i guess
yeah
i guess that for me it was very helpful
my two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing
yeah
we went quite often
in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing
when i lived around in that area my brother would fly in from chicago
we would go skiing and enjoy that
uh-huh
luckily it 's kind of unusual because hobbies it 's a nice thing to have
it 's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to like you mentioned
i am finding out a lot of the spare time that i had is n't there
that 's right
it 's taken up by activities with work with family with civic and church responsibilities for me
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i find if i make i have to make myself realize that it is important to get out there and just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
my youngest daughter is going to be starting up soccer
she 's real excited about doing that
great
we will be busy with that again
what again
you have participated with that in the past
pardon me
have you participated in that in the past
i did with my older daughter
uh-huh
she was in it for a few years
she has got so many interests herself that we had to start eliminating
the first one to go
she still likes her piano
uh-huh
she is in band
she 's got lots of hobbies or activities going on
it sounds like her life is full too
yeah
i imagine your life is full taking them around all over the place
very much
that 's right
that 's right
all right
all right
leslie it 's been very nice talking to you
is there anything else that you would like to mention tonight
no
i think we covered it pretty good
okay
great
thank you for calling
thank you
you have a nice evening
you too
bye
bye
bye now
what kind of neat hobbies do you have
i like gardening a lot
i like to be outside
i like gardening
i wish i had a green thumb though
i 've got a brown thumb
that 's what everything turns
is
do you keep trying anyway
i keep trying
you just ca n't give up on it
i bought some plants from michigan bulb company
they send them to you all ready alive
no
no
i 've never had any luck with their 's
really
right
i guess these are going to croak too
since i 've got cats i decided to get some catnip
oh
lots and lots of catnip
it 's still green
it 's been two days
i 'm encouraged
no
i have n't had good luck with that company
i think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail probably
yeah
i 've had to get my money back from them and had better luck with some of the more expensive companies
yeah
there 's a
because they
i do n't know
do you have lowe 's up there
its
building contra-
building supplies place
no
they also have a garden shop
uh-huh
that 's great
yeah
our local stores do n't offer any guarantee
some of the
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
something like that
i got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff
i 'm going to wait on those
they 're bulbs for spring or fall
probably spring
i do n't much care about things like that
i 'll make a little sort of greenhouse a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in
something to keep me occupied
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'll buy some plastic and make a little house
cute
yeah
watch the cats tear it up
right
i do n't know that
do cats bother bulbs
i think more the mice or other rodents
they just like to get in and dig
i see
if you have fresh dirt they 'll
they love to dig
i had some
i do n't know what kind they are
i 've already forgotten
just regular old flower seeds
i planted them
i was so thrilled because they came up nice green shoots coming up all over the place
my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that
gee
i have to hang these things high
they ca n't get to them
especially the catnip
how many cats do you have
three
okay
i just put a little fence around my yard which is i suppose technically illegal
i had so many groundhogs last year that i think they 'll let me get by with it
it 's got this one inch mesh
what i 've noticed it 's kept the cats out
i love it
yeah
yeah
because they like to get in and fertilize things too
why would it be illegal
because we have these tow-
i live in a townhouse
all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission
yeah
right
they want privacy fences
if nobody complains you 're all right
right
right
they do walking tours too
at least because i back up to a hillside where the wild animals are i think i can probably justify it
yeah
an
if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway
right
right
i me-
you do n't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property
right
the first year the deer ate my garden
i was just astounded
i 'm going deer right here in the city
yeah
right here bambi
exactly
gosh
let 's see
other than gardening which i fiddle at
i 'm not very good at
what else do i mostly just computer stuff
oh
i just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that
cooking that 's not really a hobby
it 's a necessity
i enjoy it
i like to think that i 'm a very good cook
great
hobbies
that 's about it
i do n't have much time for hobbies between being a student and trying to run a business on the side
you do n't have a lot of time
right
that keeps you busy
yeah
raising cats
that could become a hobby
it started out as a hobby
uh-huh
it developed into sort of a business
we breed them and all that
we did n't really start it for the money
it was just
they were fun to have around
we figured if we 're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds
now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them and all this kind of stuff
uh-huh
what kind of cats are they
i 've got a bombay a turkish van and a himalayan persian
wow
yeah
the is probably the sweetest one
she 's just a little sweetheart
we
the bombay had a litter last october
w-
i just got her back from the vet this morning getting her spayed
only going to breed them once
okay
she 's not feeling too great today
is that typical to only breed them once
no
most breeders are in it for the money
they 'll breed them twice a year i just think that i do n't know it 's kind of cruel
uh-huh
uh-huh
they just breed these they breed them before they 're ready you 're never rea-
right
they do a lot of inbreeding too
you end up with kind of strange kittens
uh-huh
uh-huh
i just do n't like that
will you breed one of the litter then next year
we sold all that litter
oh
we
there 's not that much call for bombays
uh-huh
they 're registered
they 're not they 're not show cats
i see
all you can do is sell them as pet quality
uh-huh
what you 've got is a registered pet
not too many people want bombays
they want things like himie persians and turkish vans
uh-huh
turkish vans if you 've never seen one you would n't know that it was a pure bred
it 's just medium size short hair cat
it 's got
he 's mostly white with brown and black patches
oh
they have nice personalities
they 're very inquisitive
the himie we 'll probably breed her a couple of times
we 'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those
right
it 's just the stud fees are so much though
it 'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her
we want to breed her with a champion
right
now these are long haired
yeah
the persian is
uh-huh
uh-huh
the other two are short hairs
right
that 's nice
yeah
she 's sweet
going to have some nice kittens i hope
uh-huh
she 's
if you know what a himalayan is generally they look something like
they come in a lot of different colors
people do n't realize it
they 're sort of siamese in a way
they have the gloves on the paws
they 're usually two colored
this one is
she 's predominantly black
she has chocolate paws chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters
gee
yeah
she 's quite attractive looking
uh-huh
uh-huh
hope the stud will find her attractive
that she has kittens that look like her
that she has a whole bunch of kittens
we have to be careful
we have to get a particular color point stud
you ca n't just breed them with anything
we have to get a silver point himie
that the silver will be predominate in the kittens
i see
that 's the fun part trying to figure out what you 've got to breed them with
ca n't just go out there and say you guys breed
you ca n't just tell them that anyway
that 's right
it really sounds like a business more than a hobby
it is a business in a way
it 's a lot of fun as a hobby especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats
we 're about to get another breed
we 're going to buy a
i do n't like at first
what is it
it 's a mutant
it comes from england and in the county of devon
oh
it 's a mutant cat
they 're pretty expensive
we 're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one
they 're very thin
they 're they 're long and lanky and skinny
they have real short hair
it 's curly as a matter of fact
interesting
yeah
it it 's a strange looking cat
i did n't like them at first
they 've got great big ears
are you in the market for a new car
yeah
i am as a matter of fact
i 'm looking for another car
new
probably not
oh
what sort of requirements to you have for your car
sports car
uh-huh
usually black red
uh-huh
and electric windows and power locks
i see
top of the line
not so much that as it is
i 've had so many times when i 'll have a friend next to me or i see guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window
oh
it is just a real pain
if i 'm driving along and there 's somebody next to me and somebody that i know and you try to talk to them it 's real difficult to drive reach over and try to roll down the window
uh-huh
right
right
power locks power windows are just things that just really help a lot
uh-huh
uh-huh
what about you
i guess i 'm more traditional in that i do n't like power windows or power locks because the people that i know who have them always seem to have trouble with them
oh
i just do n't like anything that i ca n't figure out why it does n't work
sure
i want good gas mileage
i want an air bag
i guess
have you ever had a car with an air bag
no
i have n't
have you
no
somehow i just think i like the idea
it sure seems to save lives
right
yeah
i like the anti-lock brakes
right
that 's a good idea
i have never had a chance to
i have been in cars that have had them
i 've never tromped on the brakes on ice or water just to see if they did n't lock up
uh-huh
uh-huh
you think you 'd buy an american car or a european or japanese
i do n't know a lot about different brands
i tend to have my requirements like the last time i bought a car i guess i did sort of prefer american
my requirements were basically good repair record good mileage
i needed air-conditioning
ca n't remember what my
i wanted stick shift i did n't have a whole lot of choice
there was one car in all of the metropolitan area that i could find that was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it
what was that
it turned out to be a chrysler lancer
huh
stick shift
huh
yeah
did it have what a three speed or a four speed
no
a five speed
basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and had n't picked up
it had been on the lot three months
they were really eager to sell it
wow
i guess in this area at least if it 's not automatic it does n't move
i much prefer a stick shift
what i 'm curious
i know why i love a stick shift
why did you want one
i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one
i thought it would be more reliable
uh-huh
it 's hard to find stick shift cars anymore
i found that out
the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when i went in to and asked and that was a requirement
huh
yeah
no
most of the sports cars are stick shift
i 'm not even sure all of them are anymore at least in this area
huh
not that i was looking for sports cars
the people i 've talked to do n't seem to have stick shift
huh
why do you like stick shift
i guess i grew up on it it 's fun
it 's an enjoyable part of driving
i do feel like i have more control over the car
uh-huh
it to me it gives me more a lot more control in snow and ice and slick conditions
uh-huh
right
it does
i do n't know
it 's really more fun than anything
as long as you 're not stuck in heavy traffic it 's fun
right
it 's probably safer on long trips because it keeps you more active
yeah
yeah
yeah
of course i like gadgets and fun things on the cars which are all the things course the c-
all right ( ( carolyn
when do ) ) you
are you reading the papers about the middle east summit
some
yes
i 'm just a little bit too
i think i was worn out from middle east after the war
yeah
i think it did n't really take over the first page quite as much as it did i think during the war
uh-huh
we definitely need something there with all the hostages and what all
yeah
yeah
wha-
that 's i think
i do n't know in the short run it would be really nice to get the hostages all back
uh-huh
i think that 's really really important
yeah
i think they just have a whole different world than we do
i do n't know
i do n't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be
i just see this middle east situation with russia and everything there that 's happened i think that that crisis has kind of slowed down
i see the middle east as being the real hot spot of the future so to speak
uh-huh
yeah
i guess i view it as being the prime importance as far as trying to wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there
uh-huh
yeah
i think
i do n't know i just have this civil rights mentality i guess
you know should we
should we
i wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do
uh-huh
i guess that 's what i hope for them
some of them do n't want those freedoms i think
their religious beliefs may not
they may not want it as a whole
i think that 's something that has to be considered too
yeah
i think that 's really a long term type thing
i know that the
it said think about long term repercussions
i was just thinking peace is peace
uh-huh
that really is the nicest thing
i guess the question in my mind somewhat
it depends on the country
i think some are more peaceful than others
uh-huh
yeah
if you look at iraq for example and the recent thing with the u n going in there and the bomb development and all this kind of stuff
yeah
uh-huh
gosh
i think we should have got him while we could or whatever
yeah
yeah
i think so
i think
i think there 's a certain mentality to that 's in the middle east the constant fighting
right
i think they realized we would probably never push him out
i think the other
probably all of the other arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out
yeah
i think they look at force as a way of their means to their ends
uh-huh
yeah
yep
i do n't know so much if these peace talks are going to
i do n't know how much they 'll stay to them
uh-huh
if we even if we say that we 're going to do stuff i do n't know how they 'll stick to that
yeah
i think the thing is though i guess the arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any ideas that coincide with the u s ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the soviet union
uh-huh
i guess that 's all gone
i think that 's really probably what started the whole process
uh-huh
i
that 's probably a bonus on our part
yeah
yes
it is
i think that they 're so much more vulnerable now because they do n't receive support from the soviet union
uh-huh
i guess they 're saying we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries two ways
we can act like we 're going to be pro-communist act like we 're going to be pro-democracy
whatever gets us the most that 's what we 'll act like we 're going to do
we really wo n't change in the long run
yeah
i think that 's the way i sort of see them all working
i tend to agree with you
yeah
i think they have in mind what they want to do
i think a lot of times their
uh-huh
it
kind of the forceful
i do n't know
i just do n't think peace is uppermost in their minds
yeah
it 's really funny as an american and always being an ally with the israelis
i always find it very hard in my heart to align with the israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the arabs
uh-huh
then again they have to live in that environment
they have to be subjected to all of the arab bombings and terrorist attacks and whatever
yeah
then they have to negotiate almost everything
then you think to yourself in your heart you do n't want to be aligned with somebody that 's mean and cruel to someone else
if that 's the environment that they have to live in and survive in then you have to sort of
i do n't know
logically
hi clarice
have you had a family reunion recently
yes
just this last summer we went back to utah
we met it was my
we usually go to my family reunion
this one was my husband 's
uh-huh
they 're usually quite similar i think
are you both from utah originally
no
he 's from here
uh-huh
most of his people are from oregon
we kind of met halfway
uh-huh
this was one
they planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and had
how nice
things like that have to be planned
they had planned
we went to the reunion in end of june and first of july that part the fourth of july weekend
uh-huh
uh-huh
we had to plan everything clear in december january to reserve that
sure
sure
was this his entire family cousins aunts uncles like that or his immediate family
uh-huh
no
wow
this was everybody
wow
how many people were there
i jeez i think over three hundred were there
wow
it was quite a large
wow
it was a great big lodge
we had plenty of room and everything
some of them live in that area
it was n't too hard for them to come in the day and leave
uh-huh
that was a great big thing
we do that with his family about every five years a great big one
immediate family we try to do one thing once a year
how many people are in his immediate family
he has eight brothers and sisters
wow
that 's big by itself
wow
it really is
you get together once a year
yeah
wow
we have a little shindig with them they 're in a close proximity
are they all here in the area
are they scattered
let 's see
there are four of them who live here in texas and his mom and dad
uh-huh
the others live in close neighboring states like nevada arizona i think like that
uh-huh
yeah
wow
that 's wonderful
it 's been fun
how about you
we do n't really get together
i would love to
that 's why i checked that i wanted to do that because i would love to plan a family reunion sometime
i have a sister in colorado and a sister in upstate new york and a sister in connecticut and here i am in texas
we 're kind of scattered right now
uh-huh
my cousins they put on a family reunion once a year
it 's always like the second week in september
it 's
the kids are already back in school
uh-huh
that 's back in the
that 's hard
that 's in new york
there 's just no possible way
yeah
yeah
it 's not really a weekend
it 's just like a day kind of thing because most of them are
my family moved to connecticut
the rest of the family stayed in new york and on long island
uh-huh
they 're all kind of local and close
they just have a day picnic
i 've always thought it would be so neat even if it were just my immediate family to have like a weekend type thing
yeah
that would be so wonderful
it really is fun
my mom 's family does it once a year just like you said
uh-huh
once a year they have a a wednesday through a saturday type thing
you can come and go as you please type thing
wow
they do that once a year
i kind of missed it this year and felt bad
you ca n't go every year
you just can not do that
yeah
yeah
yeah
do they have a hotel
where do you stay
basically they just stay with each other brothers or sisters
there are enough in the area to just kind of span yourself out
take everybody
yeah
whoever 's mom and dad it is you usually go and stay with them
i go stay with my mother
my cousins they just go stay with their mom and dad kind of thing
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's not hard in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one utah area
yeah
yeah
that 's not hard the real planning that 's the real key
that sounds so wonderful
is n't that nice
yeah
they send out
my mom 's family now
this is the first reunion with my husband 's family i 've really been involved with
my mom 's family each brother and sister takes a turn one year
that 's how they divide it up
uh-huh
then one brother and sister from each family
uh-huh
each one of them take their turn
wow
uh-huh
the parent who 's turn it is her children help her
uh-huh
if it was my mother 's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing
i see uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
wow
yeah
the thing is that the real part is there are two mailings that go out
the first one is to just kind of give an approximate date and time so you can start making
have you got a pet
y-
no
i do n't
an
my kids would love a pet
i had a pet when i was a girl
i had a cocker spaniel
i think one thing about pets is they 're a lot of company
yeah
you can tell them anything
they wo n't tell anybody
that 's right
that 's unconditional affection
right
as a matter of fact i was thinking that same thing unconditional love
they just give it and do n't expect too much
yeah
do you have a pet
i had a cat
i 've had several cats
my pet was hit by a car new year 's eve
oh
i 'm going to get another one as soon as i get back in town
i 'm going out of town this weekend
when i get back i 'm going to find a cat
i 'm so sorry
that 's good that you 're going to get another one
yeah
i know some of my friends who have pets
they just are really
the ones that have dogs are very protective of them
i think that 's one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets
they just really take care of them or are protective of them
ye-
i work and go to school
it 's kind of nice
tha-
you come home your pet 's there for you and wants a little food a little attention
yeah
an
my kids
that 's
it 's kind of fun
they really want a dog badly
they 've been looking and looking
want
they 'd take anything i think
yeah
i do n't know do you like
i guess your cat was an indoor cat
no
it was kind of indoor outdoor it was
it kind of traveled around
yeah
i do n't care for the smell of the litter box
my cat was trained to go outside
other than that it was inside when it wanted to be it was outside when
yeah
when i had a cocker spaniel it was an outdoor dog
i think i liked that better
yeah
i think
i like dogs
i think that
i 'm
kind of like big dogs
you have to have room for them
yeah
that 's true
dogs take a lot more care than cats do
cats are pretty independent
you feed them
they keep themselves clean if you raise them right you do n't have to worry about the litter box thing where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and things like that
yeah
that 's true
take them for walks
right
yeah
i see all the people on sunday going for a walk with their dogs
i 'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog
i 'm like i know it will be fun the first week maybe
yeah
mom gets to take care of it or something
i gue-
yeah
i got to take care of a friend of mine 's dog
he 's just got a puppy
he was out of town last weekend
of course the dog is not trained for anything yet
it was go over there and clean up after the dog
that 's exciting
yeah
kids kind of
they want the fun part and not the work
yeah
i think it 's really important to that if you get a pet that they 're spayed neutered so that we 're not just going on with this pet population and having to just get rid of them
yeah
that kind of gripes on me some
i do n't know
if you 're going to have a pet and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to deal with the consequences take care of the offspring
more and more people are
right
right
i think
when i was growing up we had cats
just seeing the miracle of birth that 's a neat thing to experience as a kid and understand
i think that 's really true
it was a real positive thing
on the other hand you do n't want to be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road
yeah
they 're they 're getting old now
it 's time to get rid of them
yeah
exactly
exactly
i think our community is a lot more conscious now though too
that 's good too
yeah
i think that 's all i have to say
okay
okay
have a good night
all right
bye-bye
bye
i basically listen to the news from the t v
that 's probably the only time i get a chance to take a look at it is the evening news
if i 'm lucky i might be able to hear something through news wise
other than that that 's probably how i get my source unless something really tragic happens and somebody tells me it about through conversation or whatever
most of the time it is through the news in the evening
that 's about the
you do n't get any newspapers
newspapers
no
i 'm not too much in reading newspapers
not that i do n't enjoy newspapers or anything like that
part of it is because i just do n't feel like i need to have them with watching the t v or whatever
we get our weekly news around the area
i might look through it real quick if there 's something that catches my interest in regards to what 's going on around the county or little bit of the state
the majority of the time now i do n't get a daily newspaper where i get tons of news coming in that kind of stuff
i 'm kind of the opposite of you
i get all my news from newspapers
you do
we have two newspapers
you read it in the morning then
yeah
two newspapers in the morning i 'm in a government position that i 'm in the news a lot
uh-huh
sure
i kind of look through to see what i 'm quoted in
sure
how bad the quotes are every day
to see if they did it or if they criticize you or put something in there wrong
yeah
sure
sure
sometimes there 's letter to the editor about me
there 's a even editorials for against what i 'm doing
uh-huh
sure
sure
exactly
the t v i do n't really watch even if i 'm on it
uh-huh
sure
just
that 's kind of like you said then
we are kind of on the opposite where i get home and while i 'm cooking supper the t v is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on
very seldom do i catch the ten o'clock
by that time old news is probably what i hear through the grapevine or whatever
unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then i think everybody was glued to the t v to find out what was going on
right
other than that no
it 's
that 's
c n n had the { f uh
} everybody was watching c n n
that seemed to be the place to be to find out what was going on on that
exactly
exactly
exactly
sure
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
it brought kind of more of a vivid look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things
yeah
that 's true
a lot of people that read the newspapers to get the news of what 's going on
other people that do it differently or do n't even watch any news at all
the thing is with t v i
a lot of times the news on the local t v is so brief you really do n't get the full picture of what 's going on
exactly happens
sure
sure
that 's
that 's a problem that i have is not getting just a little brief idea of what 's happening
sure
a clip a sentence or two
that 's about it of what went on
they have so much other information to cover in such a short period of time
sure
right i like the weather report
makes sense
yeah
i wa-
always i always turn that on
yeah
yeah
that 's one part i watch because i go surfing down here
i always want to watch the weather for when the waves are going to be good
uh-huh
you 're right on the coast line
you 're not further up
you 're
yeah
no
uh-huh
sure
sure
i suppose you watch for hurricanes coming in and things like that
yeah
sure
yeah
weather channel 's good
yeah
that 's about the only time in the summer if you 're watching t v for the weather even though it 's very hard to predict what 's going on
they 'll kind of say there 's a thunderstorm warning or whatever
this is what is expected
a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically so fast where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever
yeah
uh-huh
i can predict my week and where i 'm going to be
uh-huh
sure
i can be at the beach when the waves start coming in
to take off
sure
yeah
that 's
sounds pretty good
anyway i do n't know if our time is getting up here
it 's got to be fairly close to that
alright allen
the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of american women in the past several generations in the society we live in
what do you think has occurred there
i think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home
that 's probably one of the major changes i see over the last period of time
uh-huh
are they being given the full honor for the work they are doing what they have to accept that 's they are responsible for
responsibilities is what i am trying to say
i do n't think so
i think it has come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities
uh-huh
i still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals
in other words in some respects the other direction in some job markets they do n't really want to be treated as equals
by the same token in most cases women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who have been there before but at lower salaries
yes
i think that 's generally speaking pretty true
is that right and wrong
i think that 's what we really ought to look at that if they are going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay
yes
they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions
uh-huh
i do n't think that we have gotten there yet
yeah
what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years
any individual thing
is it just a general switch over
i think it 's generally that switch over
i think that switch over has been more in the work force
i do n't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force
i think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home that the husband is having them on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home
uh-huh
they have one and three quarters jobs now whereas the husbands have one and a quarter
yeah
this upsets the man because we have always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household
do you think that is going to be difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years
yes
yeah
i think also in terms of parenting
i think there is going to be some increasing problem because i think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting
i am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it
uh-huh
i think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units
do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation specifically
i think one of the things that always happens is i think is when the one end were moving out to the end where a lot of women will be at work
uh-huh
i think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties
the opinion of this career thing is n't all that it is cracked up to be
i want to go back and do something else
i think we will probably see the pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit
uh-huh
also much of it is driven by economics right now
yes
people have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in
i mo-
a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that 's what everybody else assumes they are going to get
yeah
the people
how do you feel about women in armed services
i think they ought to have the right
i have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife and my daughter going into combat
yeah
i have problems with men doing that
i guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it
it 's nothing i would be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for it
yeah
i somehow ca n't do that
i was brought up in the ages where the ladies were kept home safe secure and made happy
the men went out and took responsibility of earning the money bringing in whatever they needed and protected the household
it really still bothers me
i spent plenty of years in the service
it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or out in places where there is two or three of them there and five hundred men around
how are they going to protect themselves so to speak
i agree
it puts them in a very bad situation
i really do n't go for that
i think one of the other things that has concerned me a little bit
i think i see some change in attitudes there
my wife happens to be a wife who has chosen to stay at home
uh-huh
there 's has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who did n't have much intelligence because if she did she would be out in the work force fulfilling herself
yep
you 're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home going
i hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do that 's acceptable
yeah
if they chose to go into the work force that 's okay
yeah
if they chose not to that 's acceptable
if they go into the work force they should be treated as nicely as well as a man or any other person
as equals
not
