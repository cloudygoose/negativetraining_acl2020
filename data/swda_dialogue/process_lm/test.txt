okay bill
as you think over the plans and so forth that the company you 're working with now
who do you work with at this time
i own the company
you own the company
all right
i 'm the president and c e o of the company
my goodness
i guess i determine what the benefits are
yeah
i guess you do
what are you asking me
what benefits i think are most important
what do you think of the
let 's put it this way
what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you other than their present salary
i 'd say in today 's economy besides basic benefits such as health insurance and life insurance and some type of retirement plan i 'd say that most of the employees that we have really like a profit sharing plan
uh-huh
a profit sharing plan
that 's interesting
uh-huh
they like to participate in the profits of the company like they 're
because they feel like we 're contributing to it
we 'd like to participate in it
that means i make a little bit less
the thing is that really you make a little more because everybody has a interest in it working
yes
they have a specific reason to do so because they themselves benefit from doing a better job
right
i think most people do n't want money
it 's been my experience most people want to feel like they 're participating in something that is not a drudgery that they enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of
uh-huh
it 's a contribution
right
bill that idea fits me exactly
i just retired from the university here
that 's been the goal in my life was to contribute to the work that i was doing in my research
that 's what made me happy
that 's the type of goal i think most people ought to look for
i 'm sure a lot of them do n't
you ca n't stand in front of a counter and do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that you 're contributing something to a scientific level of knowledge or so forth
yeah
our people get a lot of satisfaction
we 're a financial planning firm
you 're a financial planning firm
yes
how many
you said you retired
i just happen to have a person that i happened to do some planning for this morning we deal with a lot of people that are retired or trying to retire
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's real important that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work where they were that that it take care of them
they do n't
none of them really want to be rich
they like to have enough to be comfortable
what changes have you considered in doing it to your company that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better
we considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a salary is tie a percentage of business that a person would participate and bring into the company
pay them based on the percentage of business they bring instead of based on their salary
the re-
when you say bring in do you mean that they negotiated with people to come in and ask for your support
no
not necessarily
it can be in-house people who help you handle x amount of dollars
okay
uh-huh
even though they did n't bring it in they help it once it 's there
right we have marketing people
yeah
we have financial planners
we have staff secretaries and administrative assistants
these secretaries and administrative assistants if we do n't have their cooperation and they 're not participating in the profit of the company they can get very dissatisfied very quickly
uh-huh
we 're thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle
administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business
yes
it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job
it might be whether the locality there those people want that kind of support
to
the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they 're the assistant to or that they usually have several people they report to that they work together with it encourages them not to complain when they realize that they get a part of the action based on their efforts and not based on being sitting back saying make me do it
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
we do n't want anybody around here that says make me do it
i do n't think any
yeah
i think most people want to be lack of better terminology they want to be self-employed
they do n't want to take the risk
in other words they like to control their own future
they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please without some real strict adherence
that 's true
which
that 's what we have
uh-huh
okay do you like to cook
i love to cook as a matter of fact i 'm making dinner right now
really
what are you making
i 'm making some
i have a little turkey left from a passover whi- which was in april
uh-huh
i had frozen it
i 'm defrosting that and making some dressing and gravy and making corn and wheat stuff that you can buy at a store which is like rice pilaf
uh-huh
we
with with wheat kernel that
do you cook
are you single do you cook every night for yourself
no
i 'm married
the
my wife is a vegetarian
uh-huh
this is n't for her
this is for our friends that came over and helped me do some stuff
uh-huh
uh-huh
stuff
uh-huh
he and i
she 's having
i do cook virtually
i cook most of the time because i
uh-huh
if you were having a dinner party what would you cook a variety of things vegetarian and nonvegetarian
yeah
we consistently
if we cook
if we have a dinner party we usually make it vegetarian just to make life easier
uh-huh
we 'll make some sort of pasta or something homemade pasta or lasagna or something
uh-huh
yeah
that 's something that 's really easy
in fact i 'm having a dinner party next saturday
that is what i 'm having is pasta for christmas i got a pasta machine
good idea
what
all my friends are really anxious to have the homemade noodles
electric or
no
it 's the hand kind old fashion kind
best kind
that that that 's
we bought one in italy
uh-huh
that 's the best kind to have
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
that 's real good
yeah
that 's what i 'm going to be cooking
i thought i would
pasta salad first
then } just something for desert bread and wine and cheese stuff like that
that would be great
have you made pasta before
uh-huh
yeah
that it 's a lot of fun
yeah
yeah
i
a lot of people think though that i 've talked to about it think that it 's a lot of hard work
i said it 's kind of easy
it actually is if if you have a food processor
i do n't know if you have a food processor or not it turns out that i- if if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply
yeah
i do
uh-huh
right
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's also
people think it 's real hard
it just time consuming to get all of the little things right
uh-huh
otherwise it 's real
uh-huh
it 's good stuff
what other kinds of dinner parties do you serve
i do n't entertain that often
when i do though i have some friends that i always like to experiment on
i see a recipe and think i 'd really like to try this cause i 'm single
i live by myself
uh-huh
it 's not necessarily something that i would cook just for myself
right
you did n't want to cook
here we go
usually i 'm pretty good about it
that 's great
i have this really good recipe for this pork chop and apple casserole kind of thing
you put stuffing and put poached apples and everything
my girlfriend and her husband loved it in fact she passed it on to her parent
i was quite impressed with myself if i should say so
yeah
that 's of make it for one person as an experiment little bit and little here and there
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'm the kind of cook that i do n't normally measure things
i just kind of throw them in
i do n't to the point of measuring down to the exact amount that they say
that means you 're a real cook
is that what it means
uh-huh
it 's real good
uh-huh
yeah
we do middle eastern dinner quite a bit
uh-huh
no
i have n't
we make cause we 're my wife is syrian
uh-huh
her families always have this food she grew up in
i 've made some of it before as well
uh-huh
we make four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple
uh-huh
we put them out for people
that 's always a real big kick for people who 've never tried it before
uh-huh
that 's that 's that 's a fun idea if you ever want something different to try
uh-huh
i would try that
yeah
i 've been wanting to take an oriental cooking class
i just have n't gotten around to it yet
do you have a wok though
yeah
yeah
i stir fry things on occasion
i 'd like to know more about more elaborate things like guess
uh-huh
it 's easy
the food just comes out
if you do it right i think the food comes out very tasty not very mushy
uh-huh
it does n't taste like a million calories of oil
uh-huh
uh-huh
really
yeah
we we like to eat even when we eat out stuff we eat a lot of chinese food or japanese food or korean
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that seems to
wok food seems to be our thing
uh-huh
anything else you cook
i just kind of cook here cook there
i do n't have any one specialty
i 'm always willing to try anything usually
that 's good
that 's always the way to do it
i think
i especially like baking and making deserts
i 've taken a cake decorating class
the wilson course
no
no
it was a private course through a com-
that 's great
i have n't the wilson class
it 's it 's neat it takes a long time
it 's like you bake the cakes
i guess just because i do n't have the expertise to just hurry up and do it like a professional would i go real slow
right
it 's a little time consuming
uh-huh
it 's really worth your effort once you see how you do
yeah
yeah
we have
my brother can do it
uh-huh
he 's got a degree in business management
he learned how to do this
uh-huh
can you hold on one second
sure
thank you
sorry about that
that 's okay
some one kept beeping in our calling waiting
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
he does that a lot
he cooks a lot he bakes a lot whenever he
uh-huh
uh-huh
he made a real big cake himself
uh-huh
it was amazing
i never could do anything with cakes it 's just horrible
uh-huh
you learn helpful hints in the classes at least
yeah
i 'm
the instructor told us certain things about do n't follow what 's really necessarily on the box if you 're making just a cake from a box do this cause make it a variety yeah
that you mean about the mix itself
that helps
some different hints the different kinds of frostings you can make
i have a book an it
all of the different decorating tips an things like that
yeah
most frostings are sort of butter cream to are n't they * [ [ to = too
yeah
yeah
those kill me
it 's like i 'm eating sugar
they 're good sugar
yeah
i think part of the problem
yeah
yeah
that 's about it
yeah
i guess so
okay
it was a pleasure chatting with you
it was nice talking to you
yes
have a good time cooking for your dinner party next week
thank you
bye-bye
bye-bye
i 'll tell you why i feel so
i feel strongly about this topic
i do n't know a whole lot about the immigration laws
i do know that in the where i live and i teach school there are so many orientals that have come here
there 's a lot of mexican people too which is not neither here nor there
the fact is that all the orientals that are here are very affluent very wise in money matters and have taken over a lot of businesses
have
ki-
it 's kind of scary because they 're so bright
all the kids that i have that are oriental are really far above the american kids
they
the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up
money is their main goal
it really is kind of scary because there 's just oodles of them
you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by orientals
it 's kind of scares me not that i do n't want them here and not that i do n't appreciate the fact that they have rights too
on the other hand you feel like almost they 're invading us to the point where they 're going to take over
right
my son once said that perhaps what we should do is buy a little square of land some place in the midwest
that might be the solution
i think probably that 's
uh-huh
i was born in ohio
uh-huh
it really
there are a lot of mexican people here because we 're so close to the border
uh-huh
they are wonderful people
i do n't want to deny them their rights
just that you you feel like when you were born and raised here and you worked very hard to make this country what it is it scares you when you feel like somebody 's taking over
a lot of these people plan one day to go back to vietnam or to taiwan or wherever they 're from and take with them a lot of american dollars plus a lot of power in american com- companies
it 's kind of scary
uh-huh
uh-huh
i do n't know
i do n't know the immigration laws that
i do not
in fact i do n't know them at all
i do n't know how many people they allow in the united states per year or if there 's even a
i do n't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore
do you know anything about that
no
i do n't
i do n't know
i lived in the middle east for sometime
i do believe there must have been some sort of quota system because i know a lot of people that in a sense certainly were deserving to come
oh
uh-huh
it seemed to take them a long time
there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come
yeah
i would guess that there are quotas for different places
i would think so too
it
i i think there 's something about being able to claim imminent danger
i 'm not sure what the terminology is
uh-huh
uh-huh
maybe political a-
asylum of some sort
yeah
there you go
you got the term
uh-huh
maybe that 's an issue with a lot of people
i do n't know
i guess i have n't been in a situation where it 's been threatening to me
my kids go to school in another suburb of dallas with very very good school systems
they 're considered one of the top three in the state both of them
uh-huh
it seems like a lot of the orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools
uh-huh
they 're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here
the kids in this area are very bright and come from parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and very interested in their education
i think in the last year if i 'm not mistaken in four of the six high schools the graduating class valedictorian and salutatorian were half or more oriental
uh-huh
uh-huh
they 're just extremely bright kids
also they value learning
i was going to say i would guess that it 's not that they are any brighter
they just maybe work harder
i think things come easy for them too
i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the united states
they do n't want to work for anything
they want it to come to them and be there
they do n't want to work hard
these kids work really hard
right
right
may-
they have
maybe part of that 's the problem that here we 've let this value slip
yeah
i know
i agree with that
they need to have some competition
what i see is y-
the competition is there
instead of meeting the challenge they 're starting to resent them
uh-huh
it 's causing i think some problems
that 's too bad
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's mainly black and and hispanic
uh-huh
uh-huh
there has been some resentment with orientals in the black community because they 've started businesses there
the blacks resent them coming in and taking their money
there 's been some violence because of it
that 's really sad
it is
it is very sad
uh-huh
i really
i 've i 've always prided myself on not being prejudiced and welcoming everyone that wants to come here
uh-huh
even when i was younger when i was in college i was a member of the n a a c p because i lived up north
i was very into the human rights part of everything
uh-huh
i 've i 've become very cynical in the last three four years living in texas
uh-huh
it sounds like you feel that there is need for change
maybe the e-
there is too big of a concentration coming all at once to allow for adequate melting into the society
uh-huh
uh-huh
exactly
that 's exactly true
plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time two two three four maybe five years and then go back and pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them
plus a lot of american dollars
in the long run maybe that 's going to make a better world too
right
you just do n't know
exactly
an-
yet with
there 's somebody on my other line
i 'm going to ignore that
oh
i just
you kind of you don- you really do n't know what to do
i do n't
i want my kids to have values where they 're accepting and so forth
uh-huh
both of my children are really more tolerant of blacks and hispanics than they are of the orientals for some reason
they feel like they 've taken over
they feel like they 're taking some of the rewards that they should have
right
i really do n't want that to happen it 's happening
right
right
right
i think a lot of their friends feel the same way too
uh-huh
uh-huh
i really do wish i knew about quotas and really wish i
right
i would suspect that they have
i guess i do n't have much much more to contribute to the topic
yeah
i do n't really either
i wish i knew more
yeah
probably if i did i might be a little bit more tolerant perhaps
uh-huh
i
even if i really wish i knew the situations they were going back to or coming from
uh-huh
you do n't know any of that
you feel you ca n't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them
right
unless
for some reason orientals are very
my good friend calls them pushy
i call them very that
they know what they want
they go get it
uh-huh
in stores and so forth it 's wh-
goal directed
pardon me
goal directed
yeah
in stores and things sometimes they can be very impolite because they get in front of you or they take something that you had in mind to get before you did
oh
i see
just going for it they take it quickly
uh-huh
they do n't think anything of that
i do n't
that 's makes people resentful too yet they have a right to be here
sure
sure
i know that
uh-huh
it sometimes it 's gets touchy
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'm sure it 's a lot different
you 're from maryland you said
yes
what part of maryland are you from
up in the gaithersburg area
okay
my sister used to live there in that area
uh-huh
i 'm sure that it 's a lot different there
it 's a lot different in iowa than it is here
no
is that right
with some of the same problems that you 've mentioned
i do n't know
i guess i was n't involved enough to really stop to think about it
uh-huh
since i teach i see it
i feel
i love the example that most of these children give our american children
yet i can see why some of the parents are fearful too
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's a kind of a touchy situation
uh-huh
i wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened it does n't happen that way all the time
exactly
exactly
right
right
anyway
it was good talking to you
it was good to talk to you too
i h-
have a good trip in california
okay
have a good weekend
all right
thank you
all righty
bye-bye
bye-bye
what kind of books do you like best
i alternate between danielle steele is one of my very favorites
i try to go into one of the self improvement books
we take books every once in a while in our sunday school class and go through them
i love scott peck and his road less traveled it is wonderful
yeah
i 've heard of that one
i do n't think i 've read it
i thoroughly enjoyed that
what do you read
i 'm a tom clancy fan
okay
i read
i just finished a book on novelle netware
that 's computer stuff
i do a lot of computer reading
yes
i 'm just finishing another one up on statistical sampling
i do more work kind of related reading than just for enjoyment
i try to keep a book going all the time
i try to read when i first wake up in the morning and then before i go to sleep
i probably get thirty to fifty pages a day read
that 's pretty good
i just
i do n't feel like
in fact this morning i was almost late for work because i 'm almost at the end of this book
i did n't want to put it down
i 've had them like that before too
i like mysteries
mysteries
any particular writer
yes
i like { f oh
} i 'm drawing a blank
he wrote the bourne ultimatum
ludwig
lud-
ludwig yes
yes
i like jeffrey archer
he is an english author who writes some mystery
i guess they 're a type of mystery
they 're usually some p-
he 's a ex-lawyer
he 's a lawyer who no longer practices his have some part of the law enveloped in them
you kind of learn something as well as enjoy yourself
right
the new author that came out with the one that harrison ford starred in
raiders of the lost ark stuff
no
no
it was the
oh what time is it there ten thirty
it 's late
i 'm tired
i 'm not thinking too well
uh-huh
it 's nine thirty here
it was his first book
it was on the top of the list
he was a d a
presumed innocent
yes
i have n't seen the movie or read the book is she kind of racy
okay
he came out with the second one
a sequel to it
both of those i 've enjoyed real well
i like that
i love danielle steele
if i want to get a fantasy and get away from it all
no
no
she is n't at all
just feel good
her books
you always cry
really
it 's always good for good tears
one book that she wrote that 's good for both men and women is fine things
my mother-in-law 's a real fan of hers
it 's always going to make you have a good cry
you know it 's going it turn out good
you 're going to be happy in the end
that 's nice
i said
i do n't want anything too real anymore
i have enough of that in my own life
i want happy fantasy
yeah
you mentioned sunday school ladonna
uh-huh
do you
are you a bible fan too
i do my share of it
i certainly ca n't say that i understand a lot of it
yeah
that 's always a challenge
do you do
my wife talks with other people
okay
what are your opinions on it
let me preface it
i 'm a
i was a staff officer in vietnam in sixty-nine and seventy
uh-huh
i 'm in active reserve now
i 'm probably not going to have the you think i would have
uh-huh
it 's
i was an interesting in that i think that he gave the american people a sense of the fact that wars are really run by politicians * [ [ i > it
uh-huh
i
are you old enough to remember the war
n-
not much
i 'm twenty-eight
no
i really do n't remember anything about it
i guess i was about ten when it ended
right
yeah
i was born in sixty-two
when did it end
december seventy-two was when we bombed north vietnam and then they released the prisoners in early seventy-three in that time frame
yeah
i was ten
i do n't remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in great detail
i think the significant thing is today did you did you see barbara walters interview with schwartzkopf
no
i did n't
i did read the book
i ha-
do ha-
i have six years of college
i did read and study about the vietnam war though
i am pretty fa-
i 'm more
what 's your perspective on it
familiar with it than
mine
i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that i think it was the right thing to do to try and not to take away to and to get rid of some of the atrocities that were going to
i do n't know i do n't really
i 'm tired of pacifist though * [ [ pacifist > pacifists
on the other hand i 'm a pac-
i 'm really struggling with it
i believe that the real warfare is not with saddam hussein or the north vietnamese
it 's in spiritual kingdoms and that the real warfare is done in your prayer closet on your knees
in a way in a sense i 'm a pacifist
yes
i do n't think just lay back and not do anything
i think lets go to war * [ [ lets > let 's
let 's go to war praying
let 's go to war for that way
the difficulty i have is that are we our neighbor 's keepers
uh-huh
this is what i find particularly difficult in that if we see injustice and weather it 's in chicago * [ [ typo weather > whether or or dallas i think if we see it we see john wiley price hollering injustice i think that 's wrong
uh-huh
the question is was there injustice in vietnam
was there injust in iraq kuwait * [ [ typo injustice
uh-huh
uh-huh
the difficult point is to where do we step in
yeah
the the other part is the when your when your when your looking at vietnam and you say is fifty-eight thousand lives worth it * [ [ 3 typos your > you 're
uh-huh
still have a problem with
i have n't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this
i know other christians would disagree with me
my husband and i are kind of not even in agreement on this
we do n't fight over it or anything
how can
the bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you
it 's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind
it 's like how can you
i do n't know for me
i do n't know i ca n't say that i agree with vietnam because how can you be gentle unto all men and then shoot them
uh-huh
could you stand there and watch them beat that guy
if your brother or your sister were being beaten by the authorities do we step in
uh-huh
in some cases we would
i think that 's what makes it so difficult
yeah
it is a difficult thing
vengeance is mine sayeth the lord
i will pay
i think god is ultimately in charge of what goes on
i know like now in china he did all these terrible things * [ [ probably mao
they were terrible
he was going to be accountable for them
if you look back and you say wait a minute while he was in power he built roads he put in all the temples he unified the chinese language
it was impossible for missionaries to accomplish anything in china because of all that
even in north and south vietnam i bet you 'd see the same thing and that now he builds roads
it
he dropped dead twenty-five years premature he dropped dead
something good did come out of that in that now you see what i mean if like now
yeah
the other difficulty is that it 's just if you take the to feed my sheep and the question is who are my sheep
uh-huh
the idea do we go out and feed these people when they 're hungry
bless your enemies if your enemy is hungry feed him
if he asks for your shirt give him your coat also
if the the the south vietnamese they asked us to help them
right
is that right
yes
they did
i think the biggest difficulty is that when your at an economy like south vietnam then reality the the poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes * [ [ your > you 're
uh-huh
the question is who was he going to pay it to
yeah
the communists are all alleged democrats
uh-huh
democratic formed government
i think that 's i think i think that 's a little difficult part there
i
we did n't understand the culture
we could n't
we had a young lady that was fourteen that worked in the unit i was commander of that appeared to be eight or nine years old
the people looked like children
uh-huh
you could n't imagine that one would would conceal a bomb and do these kind of things
yeah
i think socially it really destroyed a lot of the people that went over and saw these people
you just could n't believe that they would be mean and and and drop bombs and kill people we would turn around and them * [ [ typo napalm
uh-huh
if
uh-huh
i think there was a lot of tearing of emotions
i think that if anything that when he was saying the idea that we learned we learned a lot from vietnam
uh-huh
it was in general bad
i do n't know the problem is now
i 'm concerned a little bit that now that the gulf war is on that we 're going
i think it was a good war
it was okay to go beat up on people
yeah
i think we need a little more justice at home
i 'm not sure how we get that
wonder if there 's a connection there
yeah
again yeah
i 'd say it is wrong to
i 'm not saying president bush made the wrong decision
i think i 'm lacking in my
i do n't think i can come to a complete conclusion on how i feel about the vietnam war because i 'm going to interpret that through the bible
i 've kind of always
i 've been a christian five years
i 've kind of avoided that those the war things and how god approaches that because i think it 's just now coming up to where i really feel like i need to decide what i feel
the difficulty
that was part of the problem when they went into the promise land * [ [ should be promised land that they they did n't destroy everybody
yeah
right
they left a woman and the sheep
yeah
you
i think that 's one of those things when we get to heaven we 're going to ask god
i know
why did you do it that way
again though the grace pushes you beyond the law you know what i 'm saying
he did n't just say do n't kill your enemies
not only do n't kill them bless them
what can we do to rectify this situation
that god would move in that sovereignly
he would get the glory though no king no
bush would n't because it would n't make any sense you know what are i 'm saying
yeah
it would look absolutely ridiculously stupid
it would work out because if you follow the scriptural principals it 's going to work out because that 's the best way to do it * [ [ spelling = principle
the thing is that then god gets the glory not a president not a king
i think that 's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory
i
even at the local level when somebody 's assaulted what do you do turn the other cheek
uh-huh
n-
i believe personally
i ho-
i woman always says my husband always goes three that i guess
yeah
if somebody broke in my house i would pray that i would have this faith to take authority over that
i know people that have done that
i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes and just say i bind you in jesus name
your
n-
i just
rebuke any enemy because i believe it 's a spiritual war that 's going on
it 's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home
that 's not normal
there 's something going on there and that i would have discernment by the holy spirit to deal with pride over that
do you see what i mean
yeah
the same in vietnam you would n't handle vietnam the same way you would handle saddam houssein * [ [ hussein
i have a problem with all the killing
i 'm not a new ager i do n't believe
i am not for one world government
i 'm not for all these new age things
i i do n't have a problem with national identity
i 'm an american
having different nations and all of this
i 'm concerned about the killing that went on there because i just feel like god has a better way to handle it than that
i 've had time to think about it because we 've had
i-
i-
there 's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to i was thinking about a couple things and whether they are serious
okay
uh-huh
some things are serious
some are n't
i guess the biggest thing that bothers me is
uh-huh
not the biggest thing
one of the things that bothers me is the credit information situation that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any sort of credit extensive checks and things of that nature
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
when
i do n't know if that 's an invasion of privacy simply i do t- i do feel it is
i do n't know whether some of the questions they ask are legitimate because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your
uh-huh
uh-huh
what 's scary is about two three four months ago in the sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here the dallas morning news
uh-huh
they showed a reporter and a copy editor how they went out
they just took a fellow in john q public in dallas
all they had was
let 's see they had something like his birth date the street address
they were n't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name
it was very scary to see what they found out
they were able to find out what liens he still had against two or three houses through two divorces children 's names locations
it was really frightening
i guess then it 's just the big brother concept of the fact that once you give your social security number there are people i guess who are actually collecting all this all the time
uh-huh
yeah
i understand
i read the other day that these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone all they need now is your telephone number which i guess is involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
i i feel that is an invasion of privacy
it
i do too
yeah
the other thing i do n't like is in terms of
we just moved here from minneapolis
to get the very nice townhouse that we 're in you were required by the property management firm that was representing a private landlo-
yeah
husband and wife owners who had never done this before
they asked us for again an astounding amount of information
what we really did n't have the same opportunity
i guess that 's when i also get upset that if you 're going to do it then i want to do it too
yeah
exactly
in terms of the credit
yeah
i know we 're also going through adoption now
yeah
in for an adoption
after we gave our fingerprints to the f b i you look at each other you look at each other and say it 's too late now
it 's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try
yeah
i have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me
uh-huh
go ahead
b-
i make my living by flying airplanes for a company
uh-huh
uh-huh
as an airline pilot i have to take random drug testing
uh-huh
it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time
when i finish a certain flight on a random basis i have to have a drug test
uh-huh
that 's without probably cause
uh-huh
a- in the end now they 've spent forty million dollars
it is n't
they 've found i think in pilots anyway of something like eighty-six thousand tests there 's only been three guys have come up positive
one of them was a bad test
positive for anything
yeah
i just started working for an electronics firm down here
i used to be a reporter
yeah
now i 'm in corporate communications
yeah
part of that was as a new hire that i had to take a drug test
drug test
righ-
i had never been asked that
i thought i really did n't like it
i have very mixed feelings about it
i do n't disagree or agree with you
yeah
i think that it 's well
you 're in that field
i do n't know
it 's
we lived in minneapolis when the northwest airlines pilot in the dakotas
yeah
right
yeah
that hit the fan like
you 're obviously aware of that
yes
i am
i do n't know there should be some happy medium in terms of
if they 're going to do random
i do n't agree with random
yeah
i do n't see a problem with that
i do think i see some level of necessity in something where people are transporting other people only because of the things you 've heard about
the problem is
the reason i feel that way even to a low degree is because it 's the old story the minority make it bad for the majority
yeah
i can understand the public 's alarm to it
yeah
i 'm not alarmed
i guess having done this all my life i knew that there was n't a problem
indeed it has proved out that way
now try to get the damn thing repealed
you ca n't
yeah
i know it 's
i guess i feel bad because
not only that
in some of the instances you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints what what happens if you say no
if you say no then you 're excluded
i
does n't seem the courts
right
right
it 's a matter
that 's exactly what it is
yeah
that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion
if we did n't give it we would n't go to romania
that 's right
if
you hate to say that
that 's the way it is
it 's my feeling also that that although
i do n't know if it 's that serious
that was part of the question
uh-huh
i do feel the courts have held up a great deal of our privacy particularly look in some of the in some of the
uh-huh
i notice in some of the sexual cases they 've held up a great deal of privacy which i support of course
uh-huh
it i guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that it does seem that we 've slipped and that 's eroded
at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that it 's fair game
t-
you have to answer these questions of course
uh-huh
i do n't know
i feel there has been an erosion
i do n't really know how serious it is except i do n't like it
in terms of the privacy yeah
that in it
also i agree with that
in terms of the question in terms
i worked in medical public relations for almost a decade
that was pre-aids and all the other things that were probably there but just not labeled
i have a real problem with medical professionals
it goes back to the things like drug screening
if it 's in any level even with the potential to endangerment
uh-huh
i think this is much stronger than pilots or train engineers being screened
yeah
the transmission of the aids virus
i-
i-
that 's a real ethical problem
i do n't have the answer
i mean } i think of the young girl in florida who
yeah
that 's
was she from your part of the country
was she from
what was that
the young girl that contracted aids through her dentist allegedly
yeah
yeah
yeah
they proved it
yeah
right
i do n't know i do n't know if it 's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general or what
it
just take that step where now we feel there 's a need to do that
the next thing you know then there 's always the need to go and inspect lockers of high school students
uh-huh
tha-
yeah
the
i guess the question is
the thing for me is who sets the parameters or who has the control
yeah
i guess so
good luck to you
you just moved to texas from minneapolis i do n't hold out much hope for you
yeah
yeah
i think they 'll be a cultural shock
i was based there a lot several times in the service
i was absolutely flabbergasted at the
in at least in criminal law some of the latitudes that the police had
it 's ter-
i 'm
very seriously
no-
more than just seriously
i 'm more than likely going to be going to law school in the fall
oh yeah
yeah
if i figure out that 's still what i really want to do
the things i 'm finding out are in terms of things privacy the way the law is interpreted presented
yeah
it 's no better than journalism except in journalism it 's words
this is very frightening in that
in texas they d- they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents whether it 's domestic or international
they 're one of only five states that do not require a criminal investigation check
yet if you 're caught with
let 's just say that somebody who 's in ne-
not us
somebody who 's need of carting aluminum beer cans around
they have n't touched them
they have n't drank them
they picked them up off the street
they want to take them to a recycling resource for money or whatever
they 've been going through a lot of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again because they 've been arresting people like that
i do n't understand
if you do n't
if they do n't make a criminal check why do you have to be fingerprinted
in our case one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level because you have to deal with the i n
yeah
because you have to deal with the imi- immigration service
i see
the state does n't require it
that 's rather unusual is n't it
yeah
it is
it 's
the whole thing is
again there 's no consistency
in your
in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly i ca n't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they ca n't do it at an interval
i guess the extension of that is why not
the next thing you know we 'll just stop a random amount of motorists
if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street
they do that in texas
they do
they do n't do it for drugs
what they do is they check to see if you 've got current insurance
they check to see if you 're permits are
yeah
there 's all sorts of scare tactics i guess to to invade our privacy
yeah
i know
it 's kind of
what 's the word i want
i do n't
it 's ju-
to me it 's just frightening
yeah
the old
i 'm old enough now where george orwell
way past time
i just going to say nineteen eighty-four is come and gone
yeah
it 's here
yeah
it 's exactly true
i
the computers of course helps that
the computer abilities store that information
look at what we 're talking now
it 's
look how we 're talking now
you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger
okay i guess we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time
uh-huh
i basically read books
uh-huh
it is
i do
sometimes when everybody 's gone to bed my kids are in bed and my husband in bed
i will just stay up and finish a book that i am
i have about three books that i am going on
i will work on one for a little bit and then the next one
that 's just kind of
that is pretty impressive to have three books going
not always
just sometimes
yeah
what what kind of books do you read
just really different ones
i have one that i was reading on raising your children and then another one on an autobiography and another one on like a crime story
yeah
a true crime story
do you like those detective stories
yeah
this
it was a true one
it was just a little different though
reading that one last night
that is interesting
i like to read also
usually fall into one or two categories true science fiction fantasy on the one hand highly technical
yeah
like my husband
yeah
yeah
yeah
kind of one or the other
you must work for t i
yes
yeah
my husband does too
yeah
i am a computer scientist
yeah
i have a lot of other hobbies
uh-huh
really
yeah
i am kind of i guess what you would call a project person
really
yeah
i love
i have a shop
when things break around the house i always try to fix them myself
hobby
it 's funny
from the one stand point it is work
it is a hobby too that i enjoy to do
yeah
to find broken
yeah
yeah
what kinds of things do you fix
essentially anything you find in a house a stove or oven or a broken piece of porcelain or chipped tile on the floor just anything
oh
you have a shop
it is not anything elaborate
it is just a work bench and a gazillion tools
yeah
enough that again for anything in the house i could probably
yeah
you can fix just about everything and anything
right
that is great
in the car
i guess the car too
yeah
i think i probably would consider that a hobby
although sometimes it gets to be excessive
yeah
that is pretty much like my husband
he is pretty mobile in that area too
he works on the cars
he rarely takes them in
yeah
i
he works on irons and all t vs and stuff too
we rarely have to take those things in too
right
yeah
i think it
not only can it be fun
it can certainly help your finances
yeah
yeah
definitely
do you have any creative or artistic hobbies
not really
during christmas i work on like holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things
yeah
good
not really
yeah
i do n't necessarily either
i can plink out a song or two on a piano
oh
i can
i do n't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art
i guess graphic arts is that what they call it
yeah
yeah
i ca n't do any of that
sweat shirts is certainly impressive
uh-huh
i belong to this organization if you have preschool children
uh-huh
every once and a while they will have a craft section for the moms
yeah
those are really neat
we learn to do the transfer pictures on the sweatshirts transfer photos
yeah
uh-huh
those are really neat
we learn different crafts like that
i see
that is neat
yeah
i guess you could consider that a hobby
do you cook for a hobby
do you
no
i cook dinner
that 's not something you
i do n't consider it a hobby
i understand that
i
no
i am not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately
yeah
i like to bake off and on
usually once a week i will bake something
it 's not anything elaborate
right
at least i do n't think it is
yeah
i think that still borders on hobby
yeah
probably the other thing i do which i am sure will sound horrible to you is i program for fun on the computer
uh-huh
i have little computer projects going on that i consider hobbies
uh-huh
drive my wife crazy
oh
good
you have a computer at home
i do
yes
good
yeah
in fact there is actually several of them here right now
really
not all of them being mine
wow
then you are busy
yeah
uh-huh
that is very good
i wonder if you can construe raising children as being a hobby
you know one of the books that i was reading
i stopped because it was so
it 's
the book is so detailed
uh-huh
you have to
sometimes i have to go back and read the page over again cause i did n't quite get it all
it is so detailed
okay
i have n't been in this situation yet
my parents are not quite at that age yet
i have n't
they 're not quite elderly
no
i have n't really been in that situation although they are thinking about my grandmother that 's really about it
uh-huh
how about you
have you been in that situation yet
not for my parents
i was around two sets of grandparents quite a bit
we i put one grandfather in a rest home
uh-huh
that killed him
did it
yeah
kind of
there was some other things involved
it
before he was really active
the
there was some
he lost his drivers license
could n't get around and was n't able to do some things
we ended up just having to put him in a rest home
yeah
he just kind of became a vegetable and died that was a long time ago
no
that 's sad
yeah
that was back in like seventy-three
okay
i think the way they did things were a lot different back then
i 'm sure they were
yeah
my grandmother his wife we also put her in a rest home
uh-huh
she was in a rest home
she was back out because she did n't really need to be there physical had a good physical therapist at that place they worked with her and got her walking and got her kind of taking care of herself she was able to come back home
ah
yeah
{ c and then } she had to go back in a couple of times
oh
mostly it was just because she kind of gave up
they got her going again
yeah
i guess as far as looking do things with them and treat them like
uh-huh
yeah
i 'm sure it 's expensive
yeah
it is
yeah
it is expensive
yeah
my grandmother is not in a nursing home
she 's in a
uh-huh
they 're apartments for senior citizens
uh-huh
she loves that because they arrange activities for them all day long
uh-huh
they have where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go
she she really does love that
uh-huh
she 's just wondering what 's going to happen to me
when she ca n't take care of herself
i
{ d you know i guess it 's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she does n't need that
uh-huh
she 's kind of asking questions about what 's going to happen this ca n't last forever
uh-huh
does she have a
is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to
yeah
she can go down to the cafeteria
yeah
she can
uh-huh
because i remember in her letters telling me she 'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat
i 'm assuming it 's something like that too
uh-huh
yeah
i really like that concept
uh-huh
they have quite a few of those places like that here in utah
couples can
husband and wife can live there too or whatever
i
yet they have their friendships and relationships and the of getting together and eating together and all of that
yeah
yeah
i think it really takes looking more at the people than even really the facilities
uh-huh
she lives by herself too
she seems to like it
uh-huh
my husband 's grandmother is
she lives in a house on her own
she does n't really need the care or anything like that
she has her own home
she 's doing really well
i 'm really proud of her
she 's doing really well
we have n't had to do anything
then again she has a lot of support she 's got her mother in town too and things like that
yeah
yes
i think that that 's the thing that 's a little bit scary a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it 's almost like
that they say putting them out to pasture
some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active
yeah
they wanted to do things
they did n't want to go down and play bingo or play with the oranges
i 'll tell you my situation is i have an elderly grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home
her son which is my father is also elderly
this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years
my father 's almost eighty
my grandmother 's almost ninety-seven
jeez
it 's strange because it hit so close to home that my father 's an only child
really me and my sister are the only ones that will deal with my grandmother
she had many sisters
a couple of them took care of her
one her last sister died
it was probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home because i was pretty much giving up my life my sister was and plus she was driving my father crazy
she went through three live-in housekeepers
she 's kind of cranky to get along with
there 's nothing physically wrong with her except she 's very very old
her personality is very grating
i hope i do n't get like that when i get old
yeah
i 'm i have some great concerns about my parents and my relatives reaching that age
around here where i live in maryland in the washington area there 's
i used to live down in dallas there was just so many stories about rest homes where the people are being abused where the people are being kept in filthy conditions
in fact here in baltimore they 've actually shut a couple of them down and taken all the people out of them because they were so bug infested and rat infested
i
it really concerns me that first of all that anyone could let someone live like that
if you have to how do you make sure
i 'm sure when you make your appointment and go by everybody puts on a happy face
how are you sure that the home is really as good as it is because once you put someone into there they may not like the fact that they 've been put in there
they might complain about the place all the time even though it 's the best place in the whole world they could be just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there
yeah
you do n't know if their complaints are legitimate
yeah
we do n't have that problem up here
we might maybe in a rural
maybe there 's a bad home in a rural area
it would be a very small one
the one my grandmother 's in is very hospital like
there were some really nice ones here
all the
a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations
this one is more or less for someone who 's poor and ca n't go there
my father 's he 's no by no means wealthy
he 's quite well off
uh-huh
he could easily have put her into a nicer home
up here there 's waiting lists
that was the first one that opened
i suggested to him why do n't you change
he said these people they are very nice to her
he was saying his excuses if you move her some place else the people might not be so nice
the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it 's a really trying job
i go up twice a week to see my grandmother
i know the staff very well
they ca n't hide anything on you or anything like that
uh-huh
i have heard of really awful conditions especially down the southern part of the the country which is
yes
that 's true
my grandmother 's
last time my mother went down there to visit the place where my grandmother was staying at was so overrun with roaches that they went in and she had roaches crawling on her
there were roaches even in her alarm clock
that 's terrible
yes
it was absolutely horrible
they took her immediately out of there
they just threw everything away that she had from there
they would n't even take the the dresser that she had that was her own dresser because it was just full of bugs
they just left everything and bought her all brand new stuff
they had called a home where they were on a waiting list to get into there and explained to the person that was in charge what had happened and that they had to take her out of the home because of the conditions
amazingly enough the very next day they had an opening
they put her into that opening
that 's good
is your grandmother impaired
is she of alzheimer 's or something like that
i 'm not sure what exactly is wrong with her
up until nineteen eighty-two
i 'm sorry not until
yeah
i guess it was around eighty-two eighty-three i found out i had a grandmother
oh
prior to that i was told that she was dead
apparently what had happened was that i had a grandfather who put her into a mental institution
that does happen
yeah
it was a real hush-hush thing
yeah
i was wondering why my mother always referred to his second wife as that hussy
my neighbors across the street their mother was sick at times
they could n't handle her
they put her in a home
the old frenchman he 'd get a little drunk look round at his kids you still need your mother
that happens a lot when people are sick or they just real manic-depressants they end up being put in homes
it 's like
yeah
that 's
it 's
i 'm really glad that i come from an area where there 's good people in the homes
it 's just as
it does n't matter if it is like you say the best place they still do n't want to go to these homes
my grandmother 's real there
she cries every day
this has been over a year
she tries to make me feel really guilty
i have to put my foot down where my life begins
if that was my mother i would really feel a lot more responsible
i would probably take care of my mother
i do n't really
when my father when something
if anything happens to him i do n't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i do n't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home
hopefully that he can get along with in-house help
he 's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day because i think that 's the best situation is when you get that old and you 've been independent your whole life you do n't want to go into a home because like i say my father 's eighty
he 's really active
he still has his driver 's license here
you would n't believe what he does
he actually tows cars
as the years go on the tow trucks got better more easier
he went out and bought himself a flat bed one
he wo n't have to do very much work
someone like that i really do n't want to see them go in a home
he 's got two dogs that are his constant companions
he always replaces them
over the past thirty years i 've had about seven or eight different dogs all the time
it 's like
it 's
dad 's got these two
the old dies
the young one goes for a while
he gets another one
i ca n't see him without his animals
even though it 's very expensive to stay at home mentally it 's just the best thing for you
yes
i know
when you get on in your years it 's the only thing you really have
i 'm thinking when i get older i i think if brought all my precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home
i do n't want to be selfish a burden on anyone
that 's what i think because i see what my grandmother puts me through
i 'm saying that when i get older i could probably make the best of this place
of course it 's institutional food
everybody hates it
it 's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight
yeah
it 's a bad thing
when they go into the homes they lose weight and because of the institutional food
i think it 's fine
my taste buds are pretty flexible
here they 're always used to these old fashioned foods
they 're very set in their ways and used to have what they could get at home
now they 're feeding them quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat
yeah
just
they do n't feed them the old people food the chicken and biscuits and things like that
that 's the thing my grandmother really misses really growls about
yeah
my mother has made similar statements that she does n't want to become a burden to the family
just put me out to pasture shoot me or something
are the lines that come from her i tell her no problem mom always got a place for you
oh
yeah
i know if if people would think ahead of time and do things like that like build the in-law apartment and have it on one floor and really easy access
that 's what i 'm telling my father now
he needs a new floor in his bathroom
you can get in and out
there a lot of places to camp in dallas
not necessarily in dallas
it 's a very short drive to areas near here
uh-huh
do you do a lot of camping
i have done camping in the past
i ca n't remember when the last time i actually went camping was
it was several years ago
i did most of my camping in the mountains
uh-huh
that must have been fun though
it is
i enjoy hiking and camping
we went to the
i have some land there
it 's handy to station yourself there on the land and then make trips up into the mountains for backpacking and hiking and overnight camping
uh-huh
that sounds fun
do you do most of yours in tents
yeah
we 've done ours
i 've only been camping twice
wow
one of them i do n't really consider camping
it was on the edge of the lake
it was at a camp
i do n't like those camping grounds where you got r v beside you and then another people in tents beside you
uh-huh
uh-huh
i just do n't care for that
no
i agree with you
i think it 's much nicer when you can really get out far enough away where that you ca n't see people right out the window
uh-huh
right
it does n't
we
four years ago
it was about four years ago my little boy was three months old
the first time i left him we went overnight camping
uh-huh
we went and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake
we had a ball
uh-huh
just sat out there with our
we did n't even use tents then
we just had sleeping bags and fire going
uh-huh
we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning
does n't that always taste so much better when you 're out like that
it did
it did
yeah
i did n't even think about frying potatoes
my sister-in-law she 's always done a lot of camping
uh-huh
she 's good
she 'd think about bringing a rake so you can rake your area out
yeah
that 's right
if you do n't you 'll find every rock on it [ when you put your when you put your bag down
uh-huh
sh-
yeah
she is always prepared
she brought everything from like i said toilet paper to the rake
the only thing we 'd had to do we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill
uh-huh
we we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped
uh-huh
we broke the i guess it 's the freezing component
uh-huh
we broke that out of there and put it over our hole
what a clever idea
yeah
i would n't have thought about that
it held our pan and the potatoes and stuff
we had a good time
that 's a good idea
yeah
we 're still waiting to go again
uh-huh
if you get a chance
there are some really nice camping areas up in the wichitas which is in oklahoma and arkansas
uh-huh
arkansas
i ca n't remember the name
it 's on the oklahoma-arkansas border
uh-huh
it wo n't take but just a quick look at a map to find where those mountains are
uh-huh
i took a drive up through there as a matter of fact last september just took the drive through to see what was there
uh-huh
they have some wonderful camping areas there
pretty
beautiful beautiful country
i love to swim
i like to get out by a lake or a somewhere close where we can swim
uh-huh
yeah
right
lake tawakoni is a pretty nice place
uh-huh
we had a two bedroom mobile home there
the boys still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and build a little fire and roast their marshmallows until the mosquitos bit and then they came in
uh-huh
yeah
how old are your boys
they 're grown now
they do n't go camping with you
they go camping on their own
oh
once you start them they enjoy it all their lives
yeah
i have n't taken my little boy yet
uh-huh
i 'm afraid to get him out
he is so fearless it terrifies me
uh-huh
he
do n't be concerned
there 's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere
think so
uh-huh
it 's the water he 's not scared of
he 'll go out into it until it 's up to his nose and then try to back
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's easy to keep him occupied though on land
i know that i took my kids we 'd go out
i 've them walk with me along the lakefront
uh-huh
we 'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell and finding the biggest shell
we 'd hunt pine cones we climbed some pinon pines one year and gathered the cones so that we could eat the pine nuts
uh-huh
uh-huh
we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out
we + we searched for
uh-huh
we ate the wild plants
we gathered wild berries
it 's really
yeah
the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find
if you know what to look for
uh-huh
i had my boys build their own little three leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark
that sounds so neat
we cooked in a pot
i baked them a cake right there on a camp fire
they were so impressed
yeah
i used a tire chain and the bottom of a dutch oven
i 'm impressed
my mother-in-law
my
they 've always done a lot of camping
i grew up in louisville kentucky
there was n't
i do n't know
we just did n't get out
my mother and my father split up when we were young
my mother was n't into that
that 's who i stayed with
uh-huh
we did n't do much outdoors stuff except swimming
uh-huh
we went swimming a lot
uh-huh
my baby 's getting sick
uh-oh
i know
if our time is up we can quit
yeah
i 've got to clean her up
i 'm sorry
appreciate it
okay
uh-huh
i enjoyed talking
thank you
you bet
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
what is your opinion on drug testing
i can see it in certain cases where somebody 's in a position that perhaps a lot of lives are involved like maybe pilots that fly jets
maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people
i could certainly see it being done
in general
whether companies want to do this
i know that companies do
like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested
i know a couple of corporations that are doing that
they kind of have gotten into the idea that let 's drug test them and let 's put them through rehab
there 's got to be a limitation
do we drug test everybody that comes in
do we kind of say well you can be drug tested
you look okay because you look this way
you 're very conservative
there 's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs
the guy that does n't fit the stereotype of the conservative or whatever could be drug tested
whether legal rights of that person
i do n't know
there 's certainly a lot of things to really consider when you get into drug testing people just at the work place unless of course like i said they have a large responsibility over a mass of people
that 's about it
yeah
it it 's just not the com-
you 're talking about company 's liability
uh-huh
uh-huh
if if the company is liable for something that that a employee does while under the influence of a drug then by all means they should have the right to to to + to minimize their liability
sure
sure
i think that 's what companies are doing more and more because there are products that are out there
there 's also the case about just health and welfare of the employees
uh-huh
if a company has a healthy work force their insurance rates are low
exactly
sure
sure
not only low there 's all sorts of a financial benefits associated with having people file fewer claims being sick
sure
exactly
the only thing is
the whole question that a that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy
i do n't think anybody would argue with that
exactly
exactly
the only thing is
the one issue that i would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive
right
if they have had medications in the past let 's say once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe that week they take an advil
the advil will apparently come out positive as if they smoked marijuana
right
there 's poppy seed type things
i think that everybody is aware of that
where 's the line where you say to somebody i 'm going to drug test you tomorrow
please do not take these medications
where 's how you can do it
wel-
the ques-
right
the question becomes what do you do about somebody who tests positive
exactly
d-
that 's where the real sticking point comes in
uh-huh
it 's not
i do n't think there 's any problem with testing people
sure
it 's what do you do with the information
sure
exactly
an-
the only thing that i would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on
let 's say you 've taken medication of some sort even though they usually have you at the time list what medications you 've taken
let 's say you do come out positive
you 've taken advil or any of the ibuprofen products out there
you 've had a cold
you 've been on medication or whatever
you come out positive
is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well this is kind of iffy
are they really on drugs
they on drugs
you know what i 'm saying
where there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person is on drugs
right
they may make up their mind that let 's get rid of this employee
you know what i 'm saying
right
yeah
i think clearly the person who is the line manager
uh-huh
the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing
that should go to an entirely different agency within a corporation
exactly
it 's a
they can that the
if it does come out positive the first time they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take
you know what i mean
it 's kind of like
i think most people are aware at least now common knowledge is that
okay
you ready to discuss the topic
what 's the topic
okay
the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in america and how they relate or how they differ today than they were ten fifteen or thirty years ago
okay
you ready for that
you bet
okay
i 'll let you lead out
pardon me
i 'll let you lead out
okay
there 's
it 's kind of an interesting topic
one that i think is quite fascinating because couple of years ago i guess
not very long ago seemed like the whole world not just the united states but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in a very comfortable position so to say even though the cold war was in full swing
you had the the russians against the americans the communists against the free world
in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically not only on the political front but also on the economic front where couple of years ago america was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned
now we 're having a very tough time in a recessionary period
we 're also have a very humongous trade deficit
that 's kind of frightening
also a couple of years ago fifteen ten fifteen years ago an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life
thirty years ago that was basically it whereas now we 're expected to have a career change every couple of years and possibly four to five career changes throughout our lifetime
i think things
there 's been an awful lot of social change lately
we-
i think one of the things that 's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that they seem to be economically driven also
uh-huh
uh-huh
if you look at russia and what 's happened over there i think the change in communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing
of course i look at the economic problems in the united states right now
one of the things you wonder is what that 's going to do to us
true
i think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things i think it 's great to even have three or four different careers in your life
uh-huh
i think it must have been terribly boring to go through your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years
yes
yes
some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that aspects changing
true
true
the uncertainty of whether you 're going to have a job is not as good
the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs
uh-huh
do you think that 's good or bad
i think it 's great
you think that 's great
yeah
that 's some
yeah
because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position
they 're very comfortable
they lose the ability to learn
they in a sense become unteachable
they think they know all there is to know in the area set path and come in and put my time in from nine to five
when that 's over with that 's it without even giving a second thought to advancing their education or getting extracurricular education
i think that 's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also
i think one of the problems with education as it relates to this though is that i do n't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes
it just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes which i think is going to be a hard thing for people to face
uh-huh
right
i agree with that
i agree with that
i believe that an individual should really learn how to learn
yeah
learn how to adapt
learn how to grow in their college or whatever education they might take
that 's good
that 's good
there probably needs to be some training on how to to adjust to these changes as they come about
if you look at the high unemployment rate right now
you look at people who are in those situations i do n't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them even ideas of how to make those changes now
uh-huh
it seems to me that while those changes are taking place maybe we 're not well preparing people to make the changes with them
yeah
i read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now
uh-huh
that stress is a very prominent factor in the work place
it affects
i 'm in
like i said i 'm in minneapolis
the big thing up here of course is the twins
i imagine you ca n't escape it
no
it 's pretty pervasive
it kind of goes into about all aspects of society i think up here
i do n't know how much of the world series you caught last year
that was a lot of fun
of course it was fun for you
to be honest with you i 'm not from minneapolis
in fact i 've only been up here a few months
i 'm going back at the end of next month
to
orlando florida
really
i 'm not exactly a real twins fan from birth or anything
i was born and raised near miami and spent the last twenty years in dallas where the rangers played
yeah
oh
uh-huh
for the last roughly year i 've been in san francisco where there are two teams the oakland as and the san francisco giants
right
honestly i do my duty and watch the sports on the newscasts
okay
that 's about all the exposure i have to sports
yeah
i have n't followed it real closely at all except like i said last year when the world series rolled around i did follow that pretty religiously
went out into the bars drank a beer watched the game had a good time that way
uh-huh
sure
i guess the san francisco giants and the oakland as were the leading teams a couple of years ago
is that right
i th-
i do n't know
that 's sort of what i gather
uh-huh
i do n't know
what is the prognosis for this year
real good as far as i can tell
people are pretty excited about it
good
i assume that means good for the minnesota
yeah
sorry about that
yeah
as far as the twins are concerned it seems to be real good
my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago
they won that one seven to one
that 's pretty good i guess
it looks like they 'll be doing pretty well
are you still there
yep
okay
i heard some noise on the line
did n't know what happened
i think a train went by
okay
all right
i know a train went by
i do n't know what the noise was
i think it probably was the train
yeah
i do n't know
i i do n't even know who has been winning as far as the san francisco giants and the oakland as
i think they both won their opener
i sort of gathered that in my subliminal memory
uh-huh
maybe that has good tidings for their season coming up
i 've got a friend that 's living in san francisco right now
he 's doing the same thing i 'm doing which is basically an internship
we 're both doctoral students
he 's doing his with i b m
huh
i 'm doing mine with honeywell
i think he kind of follows the sports
i think he 's mentioned the oakland as a couple of times he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good
uh-huh
i guess they are different leagues
is that right
the as
as far as i know
yeah
in the major leagues i guess there is a couple of different divisions
of course there 's the minors
i do n't know
i guess i 'm one of those people that if i really made a concentrated effort i could really probably get into baseball
uh-huh
i was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago right after that game
he offered to take me to one of the games because apparently he and four other people from honeywell had bought a row of seats for the home games
uh-huh
uh-huh
the thing is there 's like eighty-six home games per year
there 's no way that you can ever use them all
eighty-six
eighty-six
i was amazed to hear that
huh
that 's just the home games
i thought it was a mistake
he goes no
they must play every day then
yeah
well just about
yeah
i mean eighty-six times two is a hundred sixty
yeah
that 's
yeah
that 's almost
that 's over five months worth
that 's a lot of baseball
even if they play every day that 's over five months worth
yo- if you consider it the season starts
it 's
the season started about a week and a half ago
it ends with the world series which usually takes place i believe in december or january
no
yeah
i think so
it did last year did n't it
was it november
that was the super bowl
maybe it was november i 'm thinking about
i know it was doggone cold up here
i do n't feel so bad
i think you do n't know all that much more than i do about baseball
i know for sure it was
i see
okay
it was at least two months after i got up here
really
okay
yeah
it had to be november anyway
i know the super bowl
okay
are you a fisher person are you
yes
i love to fish
great
what kind of fishing do you do
it 's mostly from the rivers and lakes
in california
and yes
and from the banks
i do n't like to go out on boats
oh
what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods
it
uh-huh
oh
i like it all except i do n't really care that much for the trout
i think i had rather have a catfish than i would a trout
i do n't blame you
i grew up in nebraska and grew up cat fishing in the little blue river
we moved to south dakota and did a lot of walleye fishing on the missouri river
uh-huh
now that we are down here i think a lot of people do some bass fishing and strip bass fishing
i am sort of a catfish man at heart
like in iowa and nebraska those little bullheads they look just like catfish
yep
yeah
they do
that 's what i mean cause i am from iowa
oh
we use to catch those little bullheads
that 's
they look just like baby catfish
yeah
did you get to go fishing very often
yeah
i like to fish
the only problem is i just moved to texas
it 's been a little over a year now i am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here
uh-huh
i really i have n't gone fishing for about two years now
uh-huh
it 's driving me crazy
one of these days i will go over to lake lewisville or lake ray hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while
uh-huh
you like to eat them after you catch them
yeah
sure
there 's are a lot of people that like to go fishing
mo-
yeah
most of the time if we catch something we 'll take it home and eat it
you 're right
i like to fish for trout
they are really good fighters
if i went to a restaurant that probably would n't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu
yeah
i know
yeah
do you just skin your catfish
do you fillet them out
how do you
we skin them
do you
yeah
okay
yeah
yeah
just cut their heads off and skin them
i just flour them salt and pepper them and cook them
yeah
i do n't put that corn meal on them
no
that 's the way my mother taught me to fry them
that 's how we do it too
although we use to set some trout lines out
we 've caught fourteen fifteen pound catfish
sometimes those are good to do on a barbecue grill and just leave the skin on and do it with butter on on tin foil
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
the skin just basically scrapes right off
wer-
it really tastes pretty good
yeah
i do n't think i 've ever tried cooking those catfish quite that big
there
most of them are just the small pan frying ones
yeah
i am hoping one of these days i 'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on a rod and reel so far it 's just been on the trout lines
would n't that be something
yeah
yeah
up in south dakota in the missouri river there we 've tied into a few northern pike
they really
in
when the water is cold they are very slow moving fish
in the summer time they 'll give you a run for your money
uh-huh
when you were
when you did go fishing where did you go
you moved there from where
nebraska
uh-huh
yeah in nebraska
it was just like the rivers and the lakes i suppose
yeah
yeah
most of the time we just fished in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in
uh-huh
uh-huh
a lot of them ended up being close to the river
if the river every flooded then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits
uh-huh
we would do a lot of fishing there too
south dakota did n't really have much for
okay
you want to start by telling me what camping is to you
do you backpack or hike
a little bit
nothing overly strenuous
no
the majority of my camping experience is a tent by the lake type situation or maybe a canoe trip or something like that
no
i 've never done a canoe trip
that sounds interesting
it 's
we 've had a lot of fun
i moved to dallas about five years ago
we 've made three different trips since i 've been here of varying degrees of difficulty
the last one we did was a canoe trip in arkansas
the river it was up about three feet
it was pre- it was pretty challenging
i imagine
we
as far as the camping part of that we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and find a clearing in the woods and go for it
they 'll fit in the canoe
you go for days at a time
yeah
yeah
it 's the
that particular one was a two day trip
what
there 's a outfitter
they haul you up to the headwaters come down about halfway and then you spend the night
the second day head on down to the pool at the end of the river
that sounds like fun
yeah
it really is
the camping i grew up with was like tents and coleman stove type
that just out in the woods
i grew up water skiing
i was from california
okay
we would go up to the sacramento river sloughs the delta there
okay
you just pick a campground on the river
right
right
cooled off
when i got married my husband had always backpacked
okay
we did that
i guess we have n't done it since my kids were born about three years ago
that was a new experience for me
i enjoyed it
i like being able to go back into the mountains or where the trail did n't necessarily lead and where you could n't necessarily pitch a tent
i bet
yeah
uh-huh
that was interesting
i have always wanted to do some white water rafting
your canoeing kind of made me think of that
yeah
that was that 's always been our next step
our little group of friends here we 've been kind of getting married off and what not
do n't let that stop you
yeah
that
it just puts a damper on things for a little while
i know
we 're starting to get everybody back together
yeah
we 'd like to do a float trip down like big bend area or something like that
yeah
you have n't done that before
no
no
we have n't made that trip yet
my parents were sailing this last year down off costa rica
they took about two weeks and went into
i do n't even know the name of the river there
they went white water rafting
mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience
she said it was truly incredible
i 'll bet
yeah
i
there 's that sense of it you 're kind of scared that risk of what could happen and then the thrill of the excitement of doing it
uh-huh
yeah
exactly
do you have anything planned for this summer
not really just yet
we 've
i do have a little bit of property
i grew up in south dakota
okay
i 've got a piece of property in minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet
there 's a little lake up there
a group of friends that i went to college with got together
we basically own all the land around this little lake there
it 's divided up into ten lots
i imagine
we 've got a private lake
it 's completely undeveloped at this point
that 's a possibility
the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime
it 's it 's about two hours north of minneapolis
that sounds good
yeah
in fact
i got married last summer
that 's
we ended up there for a couple days on our honeymoon
we kind of took a tour of the united states for about a week and up through that area
that sounds
my wife 's real excited about it
we 're going to hope to get up there sometime early eno-
last year it was the end of july
it was a little too late for the fish
hopefully get up there early enough to get into some of the fish and the the good weather and what not
we 've been wanting to start camping again this year too
my oldest child is a girl was born three years ago three and a half
uh-huh
i have a little one that just turned two
we are in the process of potty training
i did n't want to go camping with diapers
gosh
yeah
yeah
i
at a time when they 're afraid of their shadow all they need is some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent
they 'd be awake all night
that 's right
i think with him almost potty trained and she 's not afraid of her shadow anymore i 'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we 'll be able to go this summer even if it 's like over to rio dosa for a couple of days or something to get them used to it and get them started with little back packs of their own and things like that
sure
right
you bet
yeah
we 'll that
there 's a lot of places with nature trails things like that where they could learn a lot too
uh-huh
that 's true
it 's like this is this is what a pheasant looks like
now we 'll go look for one
i would need that before i could teach them
yeah
that 's
everybody might learn something that way
yeah
that 's
there 's an awful lot of things set up just anything you want to do
like you say it can be a water ski trip or fishing trip or just a sightseeing bird watching hunt with a camera type of thing
there 's a lot of different opportunities for things like that
it 's a lot of fun
it really is
hello
jan how do they recycle in texas
i
the biggest way it 's going right now } most of the grocery stores have got things set up where you can bring in your plastic and your cans and newspapers
uh-huh
they 've just got different barrels setting out
or whatever they 're called gondolas
uh-huh
yeah
yeah is it all voluntary
they 've got them set outside
yes
it 's all voluntary
they do have some places where you can take things and get cash
right
uh-huh
they just want to help recycle which is what we do
yeah
uh-huh
we
probably the only thing sometimes we 'll take the cans in
we let the kids get the money for that
right
yeah
there 's a lot of projects where the boy scouts and things that will collect your cans
f-
right
right
yeah
that 's true
that 's really the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating
uh-huh
i guess i
i guess it depends on your landfill space
uh-huh really
i know i
we 're in maryland
my
i from pennsylvania * [ [ missing copula
my parents are forced recycling
yeah
wow
pennsylvania ohio and new york are some of the
they 're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones
yeah
it 's really hard on them
up here in maryland though we 're just in a voluntary recycling stage right now
my wife and i we save our bottles
we save our newspapers
we save all our plastic and all of our tin cans
just like you say we go to a community area where they have it set up
we dump them off there
it 's vol-
yeah
it 's still voluntary though i think we 're supposed to have something implemented by nineteen ninety-three though where some aspects will be mandatory
you say it is all voluntary
do they
will it be mandatory
uh-huh
is it all
is there any place at all where you do get cash for this stuff
is it all
mostly just the cans
okay
i
yeah
that 's
most of the time like i said that 's a sort of fund raiser things that the schools do or that the boy scouts do or whatever
right
right
yeah
yeah
that 's true
that 's
cans are the only thing i think you really get money for
they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers and stuff like that
uh-huh
i think a lot of people like i said are more concerned with right now the aspects of saving the earth
right
uh-huh
yeah
i think that 's mostly
we
even before
as soon as the community said we 're going to put up bins for recycling we automatically started doing it it 's one of those things
right
just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be separated
uh-huh
that 's
i tell you it 's kind of funny now even at t i i do n't
do you work for t i
no
huh-uh
okay
at t i they 're doing recycling
for a long time they did n't do this
now they 're recycling cans and paper
we have separate bins separate wastebaskets in our offices for paper
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
they
it 's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees it 's really
right
i ca n't believe that because they 've got it all posted all over the place how much they 're saving and how w-
yeah
how well they 're doing
yeah
we do
i i work in a speech interface lab at a at a college
okay
we do basically the same thing
the state of maryland has asked all the colleges and universities and some of the large organizations if they would definitely recycle their office paper
uh-huh
uh-huh
in the giant bins around
it 's surprising how much you never realize because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage can every night
yeah
right
yep
you do n't notice until you start leaving
they do n't pick up your recycling until it 's full you just ca n't believe how much paper that you
right
i know
reams of paper come out of an office every day to recycle
you think about the waste even
uh-huh
cost wise and saving trees and stuff like that
right
it 's just amazing the difference
yeah
i think hopefully if
i guess a lot of the large organizations probably t i did they advertise on television how successful they are
n-
i have n't seen anything
yeah
that does n't mean that they do n't
i do n't watch much t v
yeah
i have n't really seen anything advertise publicly
uh-huh
and like i said they do a lot of internal advertising on that kind of stuff
internal
uh-huh
i have n't seen anything
yeah
i do n't see a lot of t i advertisements on t v anyway
i think they advertise more other places where they 're not located i do n't see a lot of advertisements for t i
right
yeah
that would probably be true
yeah
i know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television
they 'll come up and say
they 'll show you to encourage recycling
they 'll say
right
here those of us that power which is our power company that
uh-huh
we now recycle forty-five percent of our solid waste
right
they
that
we do this for the community
they put those on
i think we 're probably reaching a successful stage and just with voluntary i think
right
even in the kid 's schools they do things to try and recycle
uh-huh
i know my kids if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say look at that somebody is not saving the earth
right
yeah
the kids they really try to educate all ages
it 's good to start the kids real young on
i think so too
yeah
it 's like nobody was concerned about it
right
yeah
we were n't concerned
it 's like
yeah
that 's true
it 's like all of a sudden when there 's noticeable things saying we 're ruining the earth
huh
now everybody is doing something about which is good
uh-huh
how come we were n't doing this twenty years ago
yeah
i think really probably what hit peoples i know that here up in the the new englands area and also in pennsylvania ohio and new york all of a sudden we 're out of landfill
uh-huh
they 're saying we estimate this landfill be ov- will be full in two years unless we cut back
uh-huh
i think that that became
that all of a sudden really hit home that there 's no longer landfill space in some of the more crowded states
this is
what
no other state
i 'm sure texas probably still has some landfill space
they 're not going to voluntarily say ship your garbage here
right
yeah
that 's true
it 's really tough
i think that it really surprises me because of the cost savings
this is such a tremendous amount of cost savings
uh-huh
why
i ca n't understand why nobody saw that before
i even not + even the aspects of not saving the earth
uh-huh
{ e i mean } it 's so cost
right
yeah
in some ways i guess it does n't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it because i know that in pennsylvania they require them to put their newspaper for recycling
the de-inking process that they use to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused is very expensive
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
also it produces a waste a liquid waste that they do n't know what to do with yet they still have cost efficient yet
oh i see
okay
is not real cost efficient
okay
okay
yeah others like tin cans and plastics are really efficient they melt on quickly just because of the heating and things glass
i understand that though
uh-huh
right
and glass
right
yeah
uh-huh
i-
it really is surprising that people have n't noticed it before
yeah
that 's true
uh-huh
yeah
even
i noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil
uh-huh
that kind of surprises me
because once oil gets so thick and yucky you 'd wonder how they could clean that up enough to use it again
yeah
they can
uh-huh
i do n't know how cost efficient that would be i guess
yeah
i do n't know either
that 's
i know that though all those petroleum products though are so terrible for the water table
uh-huh
they really pollute quickly
one
uh-huh
wow
it 's one of those things that they really
yeah
yeah
i know
yeah
how terrible that is
we 'll have to keep our eyes on all that i guess
really
uh-huh
i know i really
i do n't know
i think that i think that they really are doing a good thing now
i hope it keeps
i 'm sure we 'll keep up
yeah
i agree
i think it 's really catching on
uh-huh
i think that
i 'm not sure if it
i do n't know
i think it 's a good idea to make it mandatory
i do too
it
because we were asking some people that live in north dakota are you recycling
they said we 're not forced to do it yet
no
uh-huh
i do n't know
i think that if the people are not forced to do it they may not { d you know }
yeah
i do n't know
i think a lot of people still will
i know that it 's really funny
my parents are forced to do it
they
okay
do you have any favorite teams
i kind of like them all
i played for about eighteen years all the way through college and then kind of hung them up after college
i was going to say you played pro ball
right
no
not quite
not quite
made it
yeah
made it all the way through four years of college playing ball
oh
yes
i 'm a met
i 'm one of these people who 's actually a die hard mets fan and an avid yankee hater
i think it 's one or the other is n't it
yeah
it 's
i i find it very strange
more people
real met fans do n't like the yankees
real yankee fans do n't like the mets for some reason
yeah
i never quite found a new york fan
i always found a fan of one the other
that of course means that when it comes to the american league my favorite team is the red sox by default because i went to college also in boston
okay
i see
yeah
i like the
i guess if i had to pick a favorite team any more as well as
i kind of grew up rooting for philadelphia
oh
i 'm from new jersey originally
yeah
that 's sort of close enough
yeah
we were thirty miles south of them
you were pretty close
right down the river
what are the mets going to do this year without strawberry
i do n't know there 's a part of me that says that i 'm sort of glad strawberry went away
when he sort of went away i started thinking he was performing fairly well
he really was n't worth the baggage
yeah
i think they 're okay
i think they 're
i think they have enough people who are who are still in their prime
uh-huh
certainly if you look at them compared to let 's say eight years ago or something they 're they 're they 're they 're sort of in good standing whereas i certainly do n't think they 're the eighty-six team any more
yeah
i was going to talk to you about that eighty-six team
yeah
i
that was the year they beat houston in extra innings
right
right
they beat houston in extra innings
they won the series bye-bye sort of a sneaky route against boston when there was the ball that was sort of hit to buckner
yeah
i felt real bad about that
what can you do
the guy 's making millions
he ought to be able to perform
right
that 's right
he he was supposedly
there was something wrong with him at the time
i
his knees were bothering him
yeah
right
i understand that
i say if the guy ca n't play you do n't blame that
hit it to him
you blame the team for putting him in
yeah
for having him out there
that 's right
sure
i i was i was also i was in school at boston at the time
boy
i
it was actually wonderful because where i was they were half met fans and half sox fans
yeah
i think we were all pretty much astros fans in the national league championship series
oh
there 's two fellows from brooklyn
they were they were pretty much without having to say they were pretty much mets fans
yeah
yeah
i guess they must have been scared after the
no
not really
they were pretty much thugs
they were n't scared very much
that 's good
they 're brooklyn boys i guess
yeah
you do n't expect them to be much of anything but thugs
really
yeah
i was i was also born in brooklyn
i can call myself a brooklyn thug although i 'm really not
okay
okay
i 'm not to say that all folks from brooklyn are thugs
these two were definitely thugs
they were from brooklyn
i 'm kind of hoping
i i guess any more
i pretty much pull for the rangers though
they 're they 're they they have i think they have the best facilities in the major leagues
yeah
i love going to watch a game in arlington stadium
it 's great
that 's
i think i make something because i think
in as much as sort of fan support helps
yeah
it 's good to have
the only problem is it 's not large enough
it only holds about
i think they when ryan struck out his five thousandth player they squeezed about forty thousand people in there
yes
it is kind of small
yeah
they they have plans
the owner tried to move them to florida
right
they ended up sticking around in arlington
they 're going to build a new stadium in arlington as a matter of fact not even in dallas
that 's great
that 's something that we 're looking forward to
yeah
that 'll be nice
that i think tends to keep
i think stadiums work tend to keep people happy
case in point toronto
yeah
exactly
yeah
have you seen a game up there
i have n't been to any toronto games yet
boy i saw it i was up there on business last june and watched a game in the sky dome
it was just phenomenal
that 's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums i think
of stadiums yeah
to get up there
the best i 've been up here so far in up state new york is is rochester red wings game
uh-huh
is rochester
where is cornell university
cornell is in ithaca
ithaca
yeah
cornell is about somewhere about two and a half hours south and east of us
okay
if you know where lake ontario is sort of
yeah
rochester is right on the shores is n't it
yeah
we 're about ten miles south of lake ontario
yeah
okay
whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion because they built it far enough from the city that it actually could n't be a port city
they
they say that from that space needle up in toronto you can see the lights of rochester on a clear night
i had n't actually known that
yeah
we have our own triple a team here
yeah
the redwings they 're a farm team for the orioles
yeah
okay
yeah
everybody hopes that they go all the way around here
there 's the
they 're the big team in rochester
those games are fun to watch
you you watch those games
yeah
i
we we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they 're fun
yeah
lots of really big
lots of local fans small stadium
they 'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes
uh-huh
uh-huh
especially
i 'll make a day game or something
yeah
they really seem to
people really get into it
i again i ca n't make any predictions about them
yeah
we used to like watching
my folks lived down in beaumont
on the campus of lamar university they used to house the beaumont golden gators who were a double a team for the padres i think
they were fun games to watch
those are i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes
someti-
there 's definitely a lot more hitting
yes
it 's true
one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are
yeah
i guess when you start pitching real well move them up
yeah
yeah
as far as the major league teams i do n't know the rangers have been
every year they always knock on the door early and then just go into their skid about the end of june
they 've got so much young raw talent
it 's just amazing
they just have n't been able to put anything together
the way i see it is
i can use a met analogy here
uh-huh
if you 'll think back a few years to when the mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but were n't very sort of well trained
yeah
back to maybe eighty eighty-four or eighty-three or eighty-five when they were n't quite the eighty-six team that that they were
uh-huh
right
i
that probably gives the readers a good shot for you this year or next year if i think the young talent really just has to build itself up
yeah
they 've been young for a while
they 're almost starting to age a little bit here
i just
yeah
yeah
they really hurting pitching wise
they 've got ryan
who knows what he 'll be able to do
he 's been
last year he started having some nagging injuries it 'll be interesting to watch
right
i hope to get up there
we usually try to get to opening day game
there 's several guys from our church try to go up there
that must be nice
yeah
i guess we 're maybe a hundred fifty miles south of dallas
no
not too bad
it takes about two hours two and a half hours to get there
yeah
it takes me a good seven hours to get to shay stadium
i do n't know
that 's probably because of the roads
you just do n't have
we 've just got a freeway
we just get right on the freeway and just go north
yeah
we can i can take a highway the whole way down
it 's some + it 's it 's almost four hundred hou-
it 's so crowded up there
it 's almost four hundred
barring traffic it 's four hundred hours
four hundred mil-
four hundred hours
right
four hundred miles barring traffic
golly
it 's it 's it 's a heck of a drive
we are substantially north of new york enough that we do n't get to go play too often
yeah
you 're like a boat ride from
how far is it across the lake to canada
toronto
toronto
toronto 's only about two hours
yeah
yeah
toronto i want to go see
do you drive there
do you take the ferry or what
i can
i 've driven
i 've heard about the ferry as well
yeah
have n't taken it yet though
have you taken it
yeah
it 's a beautiful city
yeah
i really love
i think that 's one of the most enjoyable things about being up here
i 'm only up here for school
uh-huh
you go back to new york after school
no
probably south maybe texas
really
some place south and warm
i do n't
i 'm not a big cold fan
what kind of weather are you having right now
right now we 're actually having
it 's getting nice
it was in the high fifties today
three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm
boy
yeah
we 've been up in the seventies eighties even up in the nineties a couple of weeks ago
that 's great
about that same time branches were falling off everywhere
we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks
golly
because of the ice
it did n't make the national news too much which i find really weird
we were
all schools were closed for over for a week
golly
there were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive
illegal
yeah
they had so many power lines down
yeah
many things like that
they were
all right
okay
what do you think of the giants
i like the giants
they got
i probably did n't get into baseball until maybe three years ago really
yeah
i just like the giants
i do n't know why
i really got into them
i read dave dreveki 's book his autobiography
yeah
yeah
was n't that something of him
yeah
that was incredible
yeah
that 's really a
really proud of him though the way he 's
the way he handled that entire situation there
yeah
really
i just think the giants have a good team
they got all
they 're they 're real balanced out
they got real good pitching
they got the hitting to go along with it
yeah
i just do n't understand why they 're not right up there on the top
yeah they need that i think they just need that one element to push them over the top
i do n't really know what it is
every team that 's really good seems
like the as they had they just had it all that one year
yeah
i was mostly an as fan
i had been to more games at the as than i have in the giants because i lived in oakland for some time
yeah
yeah
i still like the giants though
yeah
if you 're a fan you got to stay with the team any way good and the bad
yeah
right
it 's kind of hard
i still basically the
me and all my friends around here since we do n't have anywhere
we can go to the astros or the rangers teams
since no-
of me and my friends are really like either one of those teams
we
uh-huh
about the most baseball we get is t v we play it on nintendo
we play r b i baseball on nintendo that 's small town trying to make it through not being around it really
yeah
right
right
yeah
yeah
right
i prefer football over baseball
yeah
yeah
so do i
baseball is still
it 's
you got to do something when football ai n't on
hot dogs baseball and apple pie
yeah
exactly
this is america
yeah
what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams
i do n't know it 's hard to say
i have n't really
you have to just keep up with everything in the off- season
it 's kind of hard to do
at least you have to read the paper and sports illustrated and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and all that
i know
like i say if they can get that one element that they were missing i think the giants can do it
yeah
the giants are
they just
i do n't
yeah
i do n't really know about the as
they kind of
yeah
makes you sick does n't it
yeah
you hear what you hear what he did
yes
he ramming his wife 's car
i was like yeah
he 's like a little bitty kid
yeah
he 's just a a little boy with a lot of money
yeah
that 's just
yeah
i guess the giants might move away from san francisco it sounds like
yeah
i 've heard talk about that
they wo n't be that far away
san francisco will be hurting anyhow
yeah
they 're not going to be happy about it
i hope they can do good
that 's just
i think they 're a good team that just need that one little thing to push them over
i do n't know exactly what it is
they got
they 're pretty balanced out all the way through
it just might be the drive more than anything else
uh-huh
they probably just need something to push them because that 's the only thing i can see that 's holding them back is the ambition to do it
uh-huh
uh-huh
somebody basically
maybe they just need everybody to tell them they ca n't do it
maybe that 's what some teams need
look at the twins going from worst to first
i know is n't that something
yeah my roommate 's a twins fan for forever
i could n't believe that
he had his year this year
yeah
i just it
we got into that a whole bunch
uh-huh
uh-huh
that was a series to remember for sure
uh-huh
i saw all seven games of that
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i could n't believe that
yeah
i do n't
there was braves in that chanting that they had
that would drive you up a wall
yeah
they
every team with the indians been doing that now
i ca n't figure out why
you have to figure out why they 're all doing that i 'm like it 's does n't work it 's obvious it does n't work because the braves did n't win
yeah
you 're right
why keep on doing something that did n't work i do n't know
yeah
yeah
yeah
i was kind of surprised that we were going to talk about baseball
i get a woman 's voice i was i was thinking uh-huh
i talked to a guy named vinny last night about fixing your car
really
yeah
i got a call the other night about fixing your automobile up
uh-huh
uh-huh
baseball 's baseball
yeah
right
it 's kind of
i do n't know it 's kind of odd they pick
do you pick the topic or does the computer
no
they give you a list of things that you want
steve this is
like i mentioned brian and i guess we 're going to want to be talking about child care
do you have any experience in finding child care
ourselves we have i guess never had to look for child care
uh-huh
our kids are now fourteen and eighteen
you go back those many years and we did n't do it very much
uh-huh
i guess we were in a situation where we did n't need to be looking at two family income at the time
uh-huh
our kids were older
i 've had to deal with friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing
right
it
my involvement has n't been direct
still have been certainly exposed to criteria people are using
uh-huh
how about yourself
we 're kind of lucky
i 'm i 'm working
my wife is n't working
she is taking care of the kids also
we have n't had to look for child care either which has been very nice
i do have like you mentioned a lot of friends a lot of co-workers and associates that are looking for child care
some of the things that they 're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care what kind of guidance counselor to student or adult to child relationship
how many
right
you do n't want to have thirty or forty kids and only one adult
then something happens and the adult would n't be able to accommodate or take care of the kids very well
right
they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time
depends also upon the level of the child
we we take a very close look at finding a preschool a good preschool for our kid
uh-huh
i kind of relate that to that in making sure that the teachers are very well educated themselves they have a good curriculum and that they 're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them
it 's very important i feel that the kids interact with other children also
it 's a good way to develop relationships with other kids their age and get to know and work with kids
yeah
i do n't know i guess we 're kind of in the same boat
we have n't had to look very carefully for child care
yeah
i kind of think that some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care
uh-huh
even here i guess we have in one sense two forms of child care
there 's where individuals will in one primarily babysit children in their own home
uh-huh
that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to maybe seven or eight children
uh-huh
otherwise there will be
the majority are co-operative day-cares
people form a co-op and parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours
frequently they will hire staff to be at the day-care
the emphasis is primarily someplace for the children to be
uh-huh
at the same time there 's some fairly good training programs and some of them formal two year programs
right
right
that
there is some definite creative play good social interaction that kind of thing
i think it 's important like you mentioned that 's a good idea on the parent co-op because i 'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids
i do n't want to just take them to somebody i pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere
i want to trust the people
yeah
you hear on the t v and you read the newspaper quite often of people that do n't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of
hope to never get into that situation where we have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children
hope that we can stay in this situation for awhile
yeah
we 've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here
uh-huh
i guess it are
it 's typically whether it 's been child care in a home or in a larger situation where actually it 's more of an institution
uh-huh
you 've actually got children that most people would consider problem children
it 's more of a group home rather than actually day-care type of facility
yeah
that 's true
that 's true
steven it 's been
okay
i do n't have any i guess definite views about elderly care
the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see where elderly people are abused and things like that
uh-huh
yeah
i think that 's one thing that i would look at if i was putting my grandmother or my mother in some sort of home
right
yeah
yeah
i agree with you
i
a group that i 'm a part of goes once a month to they call it the heritage house
uh-huh
it 's a nursing home for elderly people
uh-huh
this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape
uh-huh
uh-huh
i watched
the interesting thing was i watched this particular one change hands
it started out just being a terrible place for the people
uh-huh
a new company bought it and came in and remodeled the whole place
uh-huh
uh-huh
hired new nurses and just redid it
just out of curiosity what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place
to me it was dirty for one thing
uh-huh
when you would walk in the smell was just awful
uh-huh
the floors if you 're walking on them feel how filthy they were
uh-huh
uh-huh
there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and crying
my goodness
of course i do n't know how many of them were not in their right mind or how many were
uh-huh
in pain or something
yeah
yeah
i just really do n't know
i feel like they were neglected
uh-huh
yeah
that was what i was going to say
it sounds like just neglect all over
right
neglect to cleanup
right
i do n't really think anyone was being cruel or trying to mistreat them or anything
uh-huh
i just think they were not doing anymore than they had to do
just kind of letting everybody live in a not very good environment
uh-huh
this new company came in
like i said they remodeled the place
uh-huh
it smells nice when you walk in
it looks nice
they got several new color t v 's for the people and redid the dining room where they made it a lot more place for them to be
uh-huh
uh-huh
they made a little patio area where they can go outside
that 's great
yeah
just small things that make it seem a lot more homey
yeah
yeah
it 's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just
i would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or anyone is in a home like that
my biggest fear that they would be is that they would be lonely
right
i would like to know that there are just a lot of activities like you said just putting a plant in a room just brightens and + and [ just makes them just a little more active
right
right
television
uh-huh
they can go outside
just to know that they 're not laying in a room looking at gray walls that 's what would just really kill me
right
exactly
yeah
i 'd like to know that they have friends there
right
and they have little conversations and things
right
i 'd like to know there 's a lot of interaction and maybe some kind of activity little field trips or something
yeah
yeah
i do n't know how they would do that
they
this place that we visit it 's really neat
everyday they have schedules of groups that come in
uh-huh
they will do bingo
our group does a church service once a month
uh-huh
other groups come in and do the services other sundays
uh-huh
that they have at least one service every sunday
uh-huh
there are a lot of things
there are places that have a lot of things for them to do
you really do have to kind of seek it out and make sure that it 's not a place like this one was
uh-huh
i did n't realize that there were groups that go in like that
that 's really neat
yeah
yeah
yeah
it is
it 's real nice
i know our church does it
there are a lot of other churches
they are just like civic organizations that do
right
uh-huh
i have other friends
it 's kinds of neat they take animals over and let the people pet them
oh
they also have a dog that maybe needs a home
they will wash it all up and make sure it 's a friendly animal and take it in and just let the old elderly people pet the dogs
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's great
yeah
that will be something they would look forward to if they knew that the puppy is coming on wednesday
yeah
that would be something to look for
that 's really neat
yeah
yeah
that really is
i thought that was a real unusual thing for someone to do
uh-huh
yeah
there 's a lot that can be done
uh-huh
it 's just a matter of people not being lazy
right
doing the best they can
again i do n't know what i 'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother
yeah
putting any of my family in an elderly home to me would be the very last resort
right
it
i know it 's hard for a lot of families if you 're trying to work or trying to take care of your own family it 's kind of hard to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent on you
right
uh-huh
i know that 's hard sometimes it would really have to be a last resort because that would just
yeah
yeah
i would feel so guilty
yeah
yeah
i would too
i do n't know
yeah
right
yeah
i know
i know what you mean
i do n't know anyone personally that 's in an elderly home
yeah
i have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because many of them of course their minds are not good
uh-huh
a lot them have told me exactly the same story and tell me something that they did
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
the next time i go it 's the same thing just somebody to listen to them
uh-huh
yeah
just seems to make them really feel good
nod your head and smile at them
right
i 'll tell you the people i feel the sorriest for
there 's a guy at this particular one i go to that i think that he 's really an intelligent person
uh-huh
uh-huh
he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just can not communicate
uh-huh
he 's blind
he has seizures
uh-huh
he 's just in a world of his own
yet he wants so much to be around people
right
if you come over to him if he can touch your hand he 'll grab it and kiss it
oh
he 's always got a smile
he really tries to brighten up your life
it 's just amazing
oh
he ca n't say anything
he can just kind of make noises
that 's something that if i had to work in an elderly home i do n't think i could do it
yeah
i would really like to be a teacher
yeah
i do n't think i could do it because i 'm very very emotional
me too
the minute something happens
yeah
i cry on hallmark commercials
i know
that 's just the end of me
i know
i mean something real life i just
uh-huh
i interview a lot of children
i 'm an education reporter
uh-huh
i always go and do an education things
uh-huh
i meet these kids who are dropping out of school left and right
yeah
all the sudden they 're in this program
they 're making straight a 's
they 're going to graduate early
uh-huh
i just want to hug them and go you are just fantastic
yeah
yeah
i could just imagine working in a home like that
yeah
those people they 're so sweet and so genuine
uh-huh
uh-huh
all they want is just for everything to be happy
yeah
yeah
it does
yeah
yeah
it is
it 's really hard one of the neatest things i think though is we always take our kids
uh-huh
i have a three year old and a six year old
uh-huh
they have gotten comfortable being around these people because they 've always gone with us
uh-huh
uh-huh
the people love them
i 'm sure
they want the children to hug them or hold their hand
so far my kids will do it just real easily
uh-huh
i think it 's because they 've gone since they were real little
yeah
they 've never been afraid
that 's something
to me children need to
uh-huh
people need to take groups of children because the kids just brighten up their lives
right
yeah
as we walk through the lobby they 'll all say bring her here
i want to see her
i would love to hold her
children
usually a of elderly people they like to share their experiences with the younger children
uh-huh
they 'll be telling them all kinds of stories that they do n't even know what they mean
yeah
that 's true
they feel like they 've lived life
they need to share it
yeah
i 'm sure i 'll be like that too
me too
yeah
yeah
it 's quite an experience
that 's great
i did n't know there were such groups
yeah
yeah
there are
it really helps those people i think
uh-huh
like you said i 'd really have a lot of second thoughts before i put any of my own family members there
yeah
yeah
it would be a last resort
i would hate it if anyone put me in one
i know
i 'm always afraid like
no
what if i lose my mind
yeah
am i going to end up in a place like that
somebody take care of me
yeah
that 's right
okay
okay
nice to talk to you
yeah
you too
thanks for calling
uh-huh
bye-bye
bye
okay
let 's start with you
okay
the last movie i saw was the five heartbeats
i liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it
five heartbeats
yeah it 's it 's robert townsend movie
who was in that
okay
i do n't know all the actors or anything
it was a lot of music a lot of old songs things like that
when was it out
it 's still out now
it came out i guess about a month or about a month and half ago something like that
it 's about a black singing group
it
it was called the dells
uh-huh
it was kind of like just about their life and their history and things like that and from how they went from stardom to nonstardom
yeah
that was pretty good
i enjoyed
i saw dances with wolves
have you seen that
yeah
i saw that one
that was pretty good
yeah
yeah
that won best picture i think
uh-huh
costner got best director
yeah
right now kevin costner he 's starring in everything
he 's doing the kennedy movie that 's coming out
there 's one
another kennedy movie
yeah
yeah
starring kevin costner
let me see
what else
he 's doing some other movie
i ca n't
i think robin hood that 's it
the robin hood coming out
he 's going to be in also
let me see
what else have i seen
what have you seen
one comes to mind here
i not sure about the name has meryl streep
what was the name of that
the ba-
the premise of the story is that after you die you go to a place called judgment city
i know what you 're talking about
my
i ca n't remem-
the other actor
it 's called reviewing my life or something like that
yeah
yeah
i did n't get to see that
defending your life
yeah
that 's it
okay
defending your life
it 's an excellent movie
uh-huh
it 's pretty entertaining
let 's see
what else have i seen lately
one of my favorite movies it 's not one that i have n't seen
i w-
it 's not a late movie fatal attraction
home alone
okay
yeah
it 's probably my all time
not all time favorite
one of my favorites that i can watch over and over
ye-
di-
did you ever see home alone
no
i never did
i heard it was really good
i 've just have n't gone out to see it
that was a good one too
was that pretty funny
yeah
it 's pretty good
yeah
yeah
somehow just never made it to see that
i need to see it
i ca n't believe i 'm just drawing a blank because i 've s-
yeah
fatal attraction i do n't know why i like that movie so much
i guess it was so much suspense
uh-huh
i like suspense
that kind of reminds me
did you ever see this is going way back jagged edge
yes
uh-huh
yeah
on that order
that was a good one too
yeah
certainly is
i liked the woman that played in that
i forgot what her name is now
yeah
that 's
anne archer she was the wife in fatal attraction
yeah
okay
she played in narrow margin which was a little more recent
uh-huh
that was kind of another suspense type alfred hitchcock type thriller
yeah
that was good
god i guess i have n't seen too many movies lately
i need to
i have n't seen a whole lot either
yeah
uh-huh
somehow
it 's hard for me to get to movies now because it 's getting so expensive
i 'd rather rent
i know
it 's obnoxious because you go in there and you spend six bucks a ticket
yeah
then you end up spending another six dollars on food
yeah
that 's just for a bucket of popcorn
a pop
it gets pretty
yeah
yeah
god forbid you should want something to drink with it
yeah
if i
if i take a date it cost me twenty bucks easy
uh-huh
yeah
easily
i do n't know
you 're usually going to go to dinner or something with that
i was going to say you can find certain restaurants that are nice and have good food eat for thirty dollars
yeah
it 's almost more fun
yeah
it 's almost more fun really to rent movies just kind of stay at home maybe
yeah
the problem is you always have to wait until they 're out
yeah
that 's true too
that 's what you 're dealing with
yeah
then you can make your popcorn and be comfortable
that 's true
that is true
uh-huh
that 's about all the movies i 've seen recently
i ought to open the paper here because i know i 've seen a few that have played
i just ca n't come up with any names here
uh-huh
[ have n't have n't been to one for a little while
did you ever see kindergarten cop
no
i never did
that was pretty good
was that arnold schwarzenegger
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
there 's a movie i do want to see
i have n't seen it
what is it
oka-
kiss before dying
yeah
whose in that
it looks pretty suspenseful
uh-huh
another one i saw is called the object of beauty
i do n't recommend that as much as defending your life
it was all right kind of funny
what else has been on and about
are you looking in the paper
yeah
oh
i 'm trying to
i wanted to get to the silence of the lambs
i hear that
yeah
that was great
did you see that
yes
that that might be one of my all time favorites too
that was an excellent movie
it was pretty scary because i was visiting a v a hospital near to where i live
they were saying that some of the patients there you ca n't leave by themselves because they 'll make a weapon out of anything
out of a piece of paper they can kill somebody
uh-huh
this guy in silence of the lambs hannibal lector he was that kind of person
you
they could n't leave him alone
uh-huh
it was really fas-
he was very dangerous
you were kind of on his side because he was so fascinating
huh
they could n't leave him alone at all
they found out what happened when they did leave him alone one time
i wo n't tell you that just in case you see the movie
yeah
i 'll probably try to see it in a little while here
uh-huh
very good
it 's been out for a while
yeah
yeah
i 'm not sure when it will be hitting video stores
it should be a while yet though
have you heard anything on out for justice
i have n't heard anything about it
i
i do n't like steven seagal things
has he had very many other movies out
he 's had out for justice
there was one right before that with a similar title
i do n't know some macho title
that 's why i just do n't like the
because it 's a macho movie
yeah
it is
i do n't like that a lot
i do n't watch a lot of arnold schwarzenegger or anything like that either
speaking of that i think terminator two is supposed to be out
yeah
yeah
that might be good though
that might be good
i do n't know
i 've enjoyed a lot of his movies
uh-huh
they 're action filled and a little bit of humor
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess i 'm not fond of the action packed movie where they 're always chasing or fighting
yeah
i like the movies that make you think
yeah
did you ever see sleeping with the enemy
no
i have n't seen that yet
that 's something i really should have seen
was that good
did you see it
i have n't heard much lately
uh-huh
i just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews
yeah
a friend of mine saw it
she said it was okay
yeah
it was n't anything spectacular
you expect more out of julia roberts though
yeah
the previews looked so good that i wanted to see it
i never did
did you ever see the original f x movie
yea-
i saw half of it
i remember i was in school i saw half of it
i fell asleep
everyone else watched it
okay
because i was going to say i always enjoyed that
i i remember that movie
uh-huh
uh-huh
it was
i got in to it
yeah
i do n't know if
yeah
yeah
i really need to go see the original one
i 'm sure it was a good movie
i probably had a test that day or something
i do n't know
yeah
it was one of those that has a lot of twists in it
yeah
yeah
it 's it 's it 's
i ca n't put it exactly on the lines of the jagged edge
uh-huh
yeah
you get these twists
it 's usually pretty good
i think though that movies are losing their luster
what 's that
i think movies are losing their attractiveness just to a lot of people
just
i think
i do n't know
because of the cost
i think it 's just losing its originality or something
i do n't
i ca n't pinpoint it
yeah
yeah
it does n't seem like it 's as big rage to get the movie theater as it used to be
that 's probably true
i i
just you see the same story lines different characters
uh-huh
yeah
exactly
it 's it 's hard to say
an
i know i do n't
i do n't keep up with it
right
i do n't try to
ju- just for that reason it does cost a lot
uh-huh
why go out and see something right away
you kind of wait
if something gets really good reviews maybe you 'd finally go spend the twelve bucks to go to it
right
right
uh-huh
i have n't been to an opening for ages just because
uh-huh
thanks for being home on the weekend
i 'm actually working at night
there very few people that are on the list for calls on the weekends nights
uh-huh
yeah
sometimes i 'm home
sometimes i 'm not
if i am it 's always fun to talk
are you part of the school system out there
i am as a matter of fact
i 'm at north carolina state
the reason i said that because i 've had about three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of north carolina
i guess they pass the names amongst your computer students or whatever
yeah
i think i was the one who did that
is that ri-
great
great
yeah
i had a
i teach a course in voice i o systems
is that right
that 's wonderful
i know about this project
i got my students to sign up
apparently a number of them have been participating
yeah
i talked to one
we 're not on the subject of course
i talked to one
i think he had a whole bunch of calls
he had a roommate that had calls and everything
uh-huh
he had way more twice as many calls as as i 've made
i 'm
of course we at t i just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will sell like gang busters
yeah
okay
you first on the subject
what do you think about latin america
let 's see
the subject is latin america
latin america
yeah
i do n't know whether i have any real profound thoughts about that
i was planning a trip to latin america
i got warned off by some people
they say peru ca n't be traveled to
the crime rate in brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth
really
t i had a place
i 'm not too sure
i do n't think they do anymore
down
i think it was campinas
i 'm not sure
i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever
they had quite a few locations
not quite a few several in latin america
i think the one in new mexico is closed
i think the one in brazil is closed
i do n't know why that is a problem down there
i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too
an
some people say go to new york
i do n't have an answer to the crime rate
it 's sad
that is a sad situation
i 'd like to go down to mexico
i keep hearing that the government and the crime rates pretty high too
that is sad not that we can sell any great program we have with crime
yeah
i think i 'm kind of like you
i do n't have any strong opinions on it
i guess maybe that 's our biggest problem we have with our neighbors down there is that we do n't have any
we have more
i guess ties
we in the united states have more ties to europe and everything
we do n't really are n't that close to everyone in south america
i do n't really know why though
yeah
i do n't understand it either although i think a lot of south americans regard the united states as bullying
that 's certainly from a historical point of view would be true
right
certainly we took far more from mexico than saddam hussein ever dreamed of taking in his wildest dreams from his neighbors
right
yeah
i know that i saw in a book
i was reading a spanish book not that i read spanish
i just reading some spanish words
there was a comment in there about the mexicans do n't really want us to say we 're americans
they would like to say that we 're north americans because they 're americans too
i guess that 's true
we do n't think of any one else but oursel-
i guess we 're kind of the smart asses in the world i suppose or of america anyway
we think of ourselves as the only americans when they 're americans too
yeah
i think they 're going to have
that 's a tough row for them to hoe because i think most of the world is going to regard citizens of the united states as americans and citizens of mexico as mexicans
as mexicans
yes
that
they can stand on their heads if they want too
i do n't think that they 're going to change that north americans i think when you say that even i tend to think of americans and canadians
no
no
i know
i just do n't think of mexicans as being north americans although i guess strictly speaking they are
yeah
no
they were saying that of us that we 're the north americans and they 're americans
they
we always say we 're americans
they want us to say we 're the north americans
i see
we 're not americans
we 're north americans
they 're south americans
yeah
i do n't know
whatever
i do n't want to make
i read it somewhere though
it 's not my point i guess
yeah
it 's so interesting i just do n't think mexico 's problems are going to be cured by semantics
no
no
they were lucky enough to have some oil ten years ago
they blew all that and borrowed more money than they can pay back now
they 're not exactly business men
i do think we should deal more with them
i do have a lot of sympathy in that we 're here in texas
for the language is very foolish
i 'm relatively familiar with texas school system
we should teach spanish at least in grammar school four or five grades of it so that we can speak spanish
i think that helps when you certainly can speak their language
there are problems with the wet back problem
for everyone knows what we 're talking about
whe- say wet back problem
we should somehow
i think the governments are working on that to try to have some businesses at the borders of both sides so that you do n't have this problem of them trying to come up here to get the jobs
there there may be some organized way to do this
yeah
i do feel for them
they are very envious of us or they would n't be coming up here risking a lot
not that they 're risking their lives of course but risking a lot
getting thrown back i guess is all that happens
yeah
you probably do n't see that
where
we see it once a month i 'm sure in san antonio they see it more often than that
i grew up in los angeles
okay
you saw it out there then too
in fact i drove a cab when i was a graduate student
i knew the hispanic part of l a pretty well
uh-huh
certainly knew that problem
knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that
yeah
it was pretty wild
i think a common factor to a lot of problems whether it be crime if you want to jump on that is mostly poverty
i think a lot of their problems is poverty
if we could
the problems we have in this country is a lot of it 's poverty
whether it 's the people are n't trying hard enough to get out of poverty that 's another story
it is sad
there 's so much down in all of south america so much potential
we 're
t i of course is really pushing world markets in their products
they 're mostly in europe now and in in the orient japan and singapore now just announced building a plant in singapore
they 're in taiwan and japan
they have n't had that much luck in south america
there 's got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything
yeah
there 's got to be trade
i guess that 's some of the answer i guess is business
i try to be an optimist and say well that 's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to get some business going between each other
we need to do more of that somehow and encourage more business between us
yeah
yeah
they 've got to have a lot of resources i would think an enormous amount of potential that way
a lot of it of course is hot and jungle and all that
there 's got to be a lot of potential down there
yeah
what are you taking in school
i did n't ask you that
what are you taking in school
i am
you 're an instructor
yeah
yeah
you 're an instructor
yeah
you said
yeah
i 'm the teacher
i give as it were
that 's great
are you teaching computer science
wha-
you said what were you saying you were teaching there
yeah
i 'm in computer science
great
great
of course this project is really one to collect a data base of of casual speech in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like
right
of course i work at t i
i 'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time why that is n't enough
i 'm i 'm getting a kick out of the whole program
there 's going to be i guess thousands i do n't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings
i wonder how they 're going to analyze them whether it would be listening to them or analyzing
i gu-
they 've got to be analyzing with a voice recorder some how
yeah
they record these
somebody transcribes them so that they have they have a speech signal
uh-huh
what
what is said
right
they 're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening
that 's a big problem in speech recognition
yes
i know they change with age
i know mine has changed
although you never found
your voice echoes in your own head which makes it different than what it really sounds to other people
yeah
i 'm sure singers and professional people know that
you always hear your own voice in recordings and say that 's obviously that 's not me
yeah
i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way
go ahead
you comment on it
yeah
i 'm glad that you 're in the business
that
i kno-
t is gotten with their speak and spell and everything
i 've told my wife that one of the reasons they 're doing it is because eventually you 'll be able to talk to your computer
right
you would n't have to have a keyboard
you 'll be able to just give it commands
i 'm sure they have some of that now
not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people
okay
what kind of ex-
do you have children
yeah
we have one that 's seventeen one that 's fifteen and one that 's just now six
okay
we had kind of a hard time finding someplace
his birthday is the first of september
uh-huh
he was going to school at five
oh
he started the first grade when he was five
uh-huh
yeah
first grade when he was five years old
you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five
yeah
uh-huh
we could
we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something
right
it was mediocre expensive
it was n't really that expensive
uh-huh
it 's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something
to learn something
that 's
even not only toddlers but your older children
yeah
it 's hard to find anywhere they 're really going to learn something
yeah
yeah
you do have to pay if you
the better the place the more you 're going to pay
yeah
parents pay when they stay home with them anyway
true
very true
it 's
my wife works it costs us more for her to stay home more than it does for him to go to the baby-sitter
uh-huh
we try to
if i had any children i hope that i 'll be in a position to stay home with my child because i 'm not real trusting a lot of people especially today
yeah
i do n't know
people
i work in the news business
i just see different things all the time
yeah
people are just crazy these days
they 're crazy i do n't
yeah
it takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend much less to trust someone with my child
yeah
we took our time
we checked it out
uh-huh
we found a preschool for him
uh-huh
it
through other folks where i work
i work at t i
uh-huh
through other folks where we worked we found a nice preschool
it was actually at a licensed preschool
uh-huh
we had those requirements
uh-huh
i guess that 's the best way to get recommendations from your friends or family members
yeah
i know
i 'm
that
i do n't think i would have left him anywhere that would
i would have stayed home with him first before i left him somewhere that
uh-huh
they still have unlicensed baby-sitters running around up here i i do n't think i 'd take that chance
huh
uh-huh
i think it 's out of sight or out of mind for less than for more than a minute or so
yeah
yeah
you 've got to be sure that these people
not that they 're going to abuse your child or anything you just have to be sure that they 're going to be watching them that they would n't let them drink something or eat something off the floor
you never know
yeah
yeah
just simple things that can be harmful
you as far as child abuse is these days you never know
uh-huh
you do n't know who you can trust and who you ca n't
huh
then you hear so much on the news about child care places
also senior care facilities you hear abuse
yeah
senior care is getting real bad
yeah
you just do n't know
you almost want to spend a couple of weeks in class with your child just to see how it is or something
yeah
you have no children at all
no
i do n't
huh-uh
gee
no
i 'm
do you miss that part in your life
no
i 'm twenty-three still have a little bit of time
yeah
yeah
yeah
it 's just not in the cards for me right now
i 'm trying to get my career going
i imagine
uh-huh
yeah
working in the news production
yeah
back to the subject
yeah
we should have discussed this earlier
it 's tough
uh-huh
it really is
it 's hard to find good child care
uh-huh
it 's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he 's going to be fine all day long
uh-huh
you brought up a good point about learning
you just do n't want a baby-sitter
you would hope that maybe they 'd come home and know some of their a b c 's or something
get them
yeah
he 's doing real well
it it has paid off for him
uh-huh
he 's in first grade now
uh-huh
he 's got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level
huh
those early ages when his mom and dad are at work and he 's actually in child care in a preschool not just child care we could have sent him to anybody
yeah
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
there 's a lot people at work that would have baby-sat him sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something has paid off not only for us
right
his attitude is i think a little bit tall for a six year old
uh-huh
his
did you take this same route with your other two children
they were outside my marriage
okay
uh-huh
i do n't know
uh-huh
i was wondering how
i would say no
all my children excel
uh-huh
they 're really good
uh-huh
i guess no
he learns from the older boys too
right
it helps that he has older brothers just to have role models and things like that
yeah
yeah
yeah
seeing
in one way we 're kind of lucky because they 're all boys
in another way we 're not so lucky because we do n't have another woman in the house for my wife to share
uh-huh
uh-huh
we faced that too
huh
he learned quite a bit not only from nursery school
he learned quite a bit from the older boys
uh-huh
he 's excelled
it 's paying off for him
it really is he is pretty smart
that 's excellent
sometimes he 's a little bit smart mouthed
uh-huh
he is smart
what kid is n't these days
yeah
i think it 's really nice to know that you can find someplace
i do n't know how it is down there in waco
uh-huh
in lubbock we have a few that you can send your children to
they can actually learn something instead of just being baby-sat
do they have any kind of program at t i or wherever your wife works some kind of day care
no
not in
huh-uh
we just
i know they 're putting that into a lot of corporations now
yeah
they 're trying to
the federal government is trying to on that too
right
no
we do n't get
maybe that will be an option for
it would be nice there
then i foresee that being just a baby-sitting thing not much learning but kind of somebody to just watch your kid while your at work
yeah
there 's not
where we sent michael the first few years there was different teachers all the time
huh
some substitute teachers in the afternoon
uh-huh
they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day
right
they had a group of kids
they put on skits
they put on plays
huh
they did the halloween thing and the valentine 's day things
uh-huh
it was important to us
huh
we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way
do you think it would have been better for him to have maybe one continuous teacher somebody that he could get attached to
is it better the other way with a lot of different
no
as a child growing up i think is a task that belongs to his parents
uh-huh
i do n't think he needed to be attached to too even though he did
uh-huh
he attached himself to a couple of those
right
i think his attachments at home
he gets the idea of what school is for
i have different teachers here
huh
this person can teach me one thing and this person teach me another
no
i i really ca n't say that it 's important for him to attach himself to anybody
right
huh
he did well
uh-huh
you
right
yeah
each child is individual learning and things
yeah
i do n't have that experience
i ca n't say that he did well
uh-huh
i do n't think we made too many mistakes
right
it sounds good
we tried hard
sounds like he 's doing real well
yeah
he 's doing real well
huh
good
he learned from it
that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be baby-sat all day
baby-sat sounds to me like you 're here i guess i 'll watch you when i get time
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
maybe i 'll clean my house maybe i 'll cook you lunch maybe i wo n't
uh-huh
they 'll probably sit him in front of the television while they do other things
yeah
yeah
yeah i do n't allow that when he 's at home
we had a good experience
we really did well
that 's good
that 's good
he served better than we did
he actually gained from it
sure we gained from it because we were allowed to continue our employment and continue our family
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think in the long run he gained from it just being somewhere where we learned something instead of just sitting around watching t v and playing all day
that 's great
right
right
it 's important
that 's probably what i 'll try and look for whenever i do have my children
yeah
i do n't know when that will be
yeah
just really look into
it will take me a long time to find somewhere i 'm sure just because i just want to be i want to be so positive that my children are okay as well as the other children in the center
yeah
yeah
his mom did n't go back to work until when he was six months old
uh-huh
we just did n't want to dump him somewhere and make him feel like he was n't wanted
uh-huh
exactly
we wanted his center of attention at home we did what we could
uh-huh
it worked out real well
i 'm glad we were so careful
it 's difficult these day
it 's a lot more difficult these days because you have both parents working a lot of times
yeah
you have to find day care whereas here
most of the time now it 's a necessity
uh-huh
you ca n't afford
uh-huh
i 'm not making seventy or eighty thousand dollars a year
uh-huh
no choice
child care 's a necessity whereas years ago the husband basically worked and the wife basically stayed home
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'm forty now
when i was a kid mom was always at home
right
we did n't
i think that has a lot to do with just all children how they learn and things just because the basic family is breaking
yeah
it is
yeah
it is
the basic family is not there anymore
i 'll agree with that it is
it 's not there
uh-huh
i think that plays a big part in a child 's learning and you know what they can and can not do in child care
yeah
i do n't think
been on the line for awhile
i almost forgot what the topic was
okay
based
i know what it is
okay
good
let me see
i i i i 'm kind of
i do n't
i 'm i 'm kind of in the middle
i think it 's a great idea
uh-huh
when it comes to me it 's almost an insult
it 's
i 've come from the teaching field
right
so do i
it 's just like i do n't know i guess i guess i 'd have to go with
uh-huh
i i would i would probably go for going ahead and doing it if it 's got to be done for everyone
right
i think if it 's got to be done for one person in the company it should be random testing it should be for everybody
right
when they answer the company i think it 'll make it a lot easier
right
yeah
i do n't know i come from the teaching field too
it sort of
it 's a pro and a con ty-
i do n't know where to stand on it
yeah
i 'm more or less if they told me i had to then fine if they made me then i 'd probably
yeah
if i had my druthers i 'd probably say no
just this
yeah
you kind of goes into your privacy i guess if they
right
there 's
i guess there 's some companies that are doing it
uh-huh
it seems to be working out
yeah
yeah
right
anybody who is does n't accept the rehab program then they 're more or less getting laid off
hard
that 's a
it 's really weird issue
i 'm sort of on the fence about it
yeah
yeah
i
that 's what 's they 're coming across as some of the companies anyhow
we can get you into a drug program
you wear that stigma
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
then i kind of hear it goes into
right
anything with a
if you drink a lot of caffeine or
i did n't know that
yeah
somebody was telling me if you drink it in an awful lot of caffeine that that can show up as a positive test
i know i 'm an epileptic
i 'd probably test positive i 'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system
yeah
things like that
yeah
a lot of times those are the things i do n't like to disclose to an employer because then they do n't want to have anything to do with you
right
right
uh-huh
it 's very personal
i would n't want to have it disclosed because then i 'd always wonder if they fired me why did you fire me
see that 's
yeah
that 's where i kind of get into
it kind of gets into your personal life what 's kind of next
uh-huh
yeah
the what
orwell
huh
oh
yeah
i sh-
i 'd hate to have to
if i had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who did n't
right
yeah
right
i can understand why they need it with all the train accidents and everything else
do you think they 'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually
i kind of think they will
i think they will too because it 's just going to follow
yeah
i do n't know we have n't had any of it in our school system hopefully we wo n't
yeah
we have n't either
yeah
i i just kind of think it 's heading that way though it 's just because it 's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff i just kind of think it 's going to eventually head that way
right
eventually it 's going to be not only the tea-
the kids are going to be under scrutiny it 's going to be the teachers
yeah
right
if they can test the teachers that gives them the full right to test the kids
right
they caught everybody
yeah
tell me about your home
my home
all right
my home is about fifteen years old
all right
it 's a two story house
it 's our first home
it looks like it 's going to be the last
i think we 're going to demolish it
we 've got two children
it 's
they have scraped the plaster off the walls with riding their little toys through it and stuff
yes
put dents in the tiles just multitude of them
even places
it 's past the dent stage
we 're talking some of it 's been away
i do n't know what they
we talking from dents in the holes
yeah
dents in the
right
i understand
i 've got a daughter
we 've got two
one of them 's eleven
one of them 's seven
the carpet
we need to replace the carpet
it sounds like it 's just the pits
it 's not all that bad
they 're just real hard on it
kids are hard on houses
definitely
i can see why people wait until they get in high school or maybe junior high
they get another one
yeah
yeah
we live in a mobile home
that 's probably not typical america
i know there 's a lot of them
it 's
what we have
it 's all we can afford
yeah because they 're always something
seems like we 're always working on it as i 'm sure it is with your house
yeah
how old is your child
ten
girl
just like yours ours is always
we 're
something else goes wrong always
it 's
some appliances breaking or something
no
appliances
we had a couple plumbing problems
we 've
who knows it 's always something with homes
you said you were in colorado springs
yes
are there a lot of trailers around there
yeah
there are there 's a big military constituency
is that what you 're in
no
no
i work for t i
then that 's why you 're doing this then is n't it
yes
okay
what division are you in
i 'm not in t i
oh
i had a friend that had a roommate that worked for t i
she saw this come up on the computer screen and ran it off and passed it to the people that were interested
it 's not a hobby
it 's something to do
i get to here about texas again a bit and get to talk to people all over the country
you know that i 've talked to someone in maryland i believe it was
i know i 've been talking to people in ohio and virginia and i think california
it 's interesting is n't it
yeah
it is
the gal i talked to in maryland did n't own a car
she 's never traveled anywhere
she 's never been anywhere
she
i talked about one of the biggest problems in the united states being our roads
she did n't understand
she does n't drive
how does she get to work
she lives on campus
she 's a college student
buses and public transportation
uh-huh
i had a re-
her parents live by the public transportation
i wish we could down here
it would be nice
i kind of like the freedom too do n't you
sometimes
i tell you i 'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work
if i did it it would take me an hour and fifteen minutes
i would have to get on one and drive or walk to a bu-
there 's one terminal close to us
they 'd drive me to the main terminal here
right
then i 'd have to go to downtown dallas and then walk over couple blocks and get on another bus to go to my school
if it 's anything like
that 's too much
dallas always has been
no one wants to be at downtown dallas much
yeah
there sure are a lot of people that work down there
is the crime rate still bad
definitely
i went down there a couple maybe three weeks ago for a trial
all these people were standing up that was during the workday all along the streets just all around these vacant buildings a lot of vacant buildings
they 're just being demolished
they stink
yeah
that 's terrible
uh-huh
garland how nice is it now
it 's been a while since i 've been there
i think it might be up to two hundred and fifty thousand
it 's gotten big
yes
it has
i think when we moved here it was like a hundred and twenty something like that
i did n't realize when i moved here that it was a separate town from dallas
yeah
it is
i know now
i did n't
where you from
i 'm from kilgore texas
it 's in east
kilgore
i know where kilgore is
where you from
i 'm originally from lubbock
are you
yeah
why did you move up to colorado
seemed like the thing to do at the time
it 's real pretty up there
i have a friend in denver
i love it the mountains
i love the mountains
what do you
back to the topic
what
it seems that more and more people are not owning traditional homes these days
they 're not owning homes period
yeah
yeah
everyone says
when i bought this several years ago when our local economy was good everyone said no no you 're crazy to buy a mobile home
uh-huh
now it seems that with the local economy bad and t i
it seems that
it was n't such a bad idea
they 're doing some back pedaling
have you got land
no
i 'm renting at the time
i did that one year
i lived with two other girls
we all taught
it was a two bedroom
we took turns sharing the bedroom
gosh
yeah
i got to where i decided i wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom
we had two baths
it was just the little bathroom were the thing that really bothered me because i felt real closed in
mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one
that was in the seventies
ours is wood sided
uh-huh
it has a traditional roof
i 'm sorry
it 's nine hundred and eighty square foot
what two bedroom one bath rooms are nice sized
uh-huh have you got it under
you can imagine nine hundred eighty square foot broke up into two bedrooms one bath
it 's comfy
yes
are you required to by law
we were down here
it was already setup when we bought it
yeah
i bet it 's not bad
yeah
it 's wood sided it has sheetrock everywhere
it 's quieter than you remember mobile homes to be
okay
how much is yours
when we bought ours we were paying three hundred twenty-nine dollars
our payments are like two twenty
for how many years
fifteen
it was still a lot cheaper
what
it was still a lot cheaper than what we gave because ours is thirty years
we bought one of the cheapest houses a tract house
yeah
yes
a mobile home 's a heck of a lot cheaper
which probably did n't make much difference
it did
in it
no
no
no
what i meant not in quality
what i meant was four years equity costs five hundred dollars
in the price
nice
that sounds good
there 's not that much time left on the loan
if the economy gets better are you going to get another house
i do n't know
no
to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our mobile home and have it so close to paid for
it 's like me to pickup and move somewhere else is easy
you would n't take that mobile home
right
sure
you would
sure
absolutely
it would be cheaper to move that than buy another one
absolutely
when you talk about the deal i got it would be cheaper
especially if it were a paid move or something
there 's some paid moves occasionally
t i would pay to move you
i do n't know
they did
when i moved up here
they might want to move away
how many years you been up there
six or seven
do you snow ski
a little bit
mostly i just love walking in the mountains driving in the mountains
it 's real pretty
i went rock climbing one time
that 's exciting
my friend talked me in that
i 'm a real scaredy when it comes to heights
once we got on top of the rocks it was quite
okay i guess we 're on
yeah
central america have you ever lived in central america
i was n't in central america
talking about latin america i consider latin america to include central and south america
i did live in brazil for four years
do you think that we should have given up the panama canal
realistically i
yes
i do n't see the panama canal that has n't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it 's not really big enough to accommodate the shipping that it once did
maybe it would be better that we let the panamanians run it however i think we 're certainly justified in our actions dealing with noriega in this
there are those that that think that that the panama canal has some considerable strategic importance particularly for the military
interestingly enough my father who was in world war one and as a civil engineer they they offered him a commission as a captain if he would go in and help with the defenses of the panama canal
he had worked for united fruit company there
uh-huh
they in fact they had
this was in the late twenties
they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over
he turned them down
it 's interesting that most people do n't realize how small the canal is
have you ever been there
no
i have n't
it 's really
i have n't been there
i 've been to been to salvador
in fact we went back to visit some friends of my fathers that we went in fifty-seven i guess
interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite easily
the thing i find interesting though is the whole colonial approach
do we support the sandinistas or do we support
they thought that nicaragua if you gave them a free election they would vote for the
will you
did you ever studied the political makeup there in in nicaragua
i have a little bit
i ca n't say that i would be an expert on on the region
certainly it gets there
your
you 've got this toss up betw-
not so much a toss up but a dilemma when you want a country to have its own dominion or its free rein over its own people
we 're in this dilemma over united states believes in democracy and self determination where
that
on the other hand we believe in self preservation and not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about soviet influence in what 's considered to be the united states sphere of the world which is not only we used to see spheres
now we 're in a situation where the united states looks like we 're it now
the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic
i do n't know if you read any of the history on where the panama canal
there was an option to build it across nicaragua
there 's a big there 's a big lake
uh-huh
from a technical standpoint it would n't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in nicaragua
the united states had some
i 've forgotten what the political influence was
there were economic ties then
the issue of
if it 's in the economic interest of the united states do we go in and prevail
in other words do we make the world safe for democracy
right
if there 's no economic benefit
i think particularly if you 're looking at the at the peasant whether he 's in central america regardless of where he is is his life better off under communism or or democratic government
you look at salvador where the
he does n't care as long as he 's feeding his family
yeah
the question is does the government make a difference
if they 'll mostly leave him alone
i think that 's the difficulty that we have that it reality does n't make any difference if he has no income
apparently even some of our alleged central american leaders that are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things
it 's
yeah
yo-
in looking bu-
if you look at the region in
to their detriment they came from this hundreds of years of spanish control
the spaniards have horrible history of corrupt government greedy rulers who have been manipulating their public for their own good
if you go back to the kings and the conquistadors coming in and the incredibly horrible things they did to the native tribes
they make the things that custer did look trivial
you get
it is interesting that we look at the exploitation
we accuse some other people of exploiting them
americans have a pretty good reputation of exploiting
basically the panama canal we went in took it
absolutely
we set up
we stole it fair and square
an
teddy roosevelt did n't have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick for nothing
right
what 's america 's role there
it
with other things going on it seems to have lessened
you 've still got cuba that exerts some influence
the only thing i see about cuba though is after fidel castro dies i do n't think they 'll be a communist power anymore
i ca n't see communism in that country carrying on past him
when you take a situation where i think in particular in salvador where there is a significant under class
that
having a lot of difficulty surviving the question is would they be better off under communism
yeah
i do n't know that i would advocate communism
the question is can you can can a democracy afford the
it 's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the u s that 's essentially an underclass
right
when you get enough of them communism would feed them all
ye-
i do n't know if maybe communism is the right word for it
what we would
there would have to be some kind of
there may be a point at which you might want to consider some kind of socialistic organization or socialistic set up to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy
that
yeah
if the guys got some incentive
if he 's got
if he can raise enough coffee and bananas to where he 's got something to protect
other
right
right
whether he can export or at least set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest
cocoa leaves sell real well right now it seems
yeah
yeah
as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments
absolutely
i do n't
it 's going to be hard to
we
if you
that 's where your absolutely right is we 've got to do something in that region to encourage or to make him growing bananas profitable again
yes
the question is if somebody offered a thousand dollars a day to grow something in your backyard would you do it
right
not that we could be bought
i 've got to watch what i say here
i never know when the d i a may be listening on my phone
of course everything we 're saying is being recorded
right
of course
of course
yeah
it 's tempting
it 's got to be horribly tempting for those peasants
particularly if you 're hungry
yeah
yeah
you
it 's not just a matter of having an extra car or having a better car this is a matter for them of feeding themselves their wife and their family
you
there 's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family
there 's dishonor in not being able to do it
starving to death is not a whole lot of fun either
that
no
no
uh-huh
in reality i think what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people and help them protect themselves
not that they
i 'm not sure the catholic church is is particularly political
if
right
are you a t ier
no
i 'm not
really
that 's great
my daughter talked to a student
in general most people doing this are t iers
i guess customers too
i think a great number of students who got word of it and participated in general and voiced who heard about the program
yeah
t is got a lot of advances in it really
hopefully this will turn out to be a good program for us
we sure need the business
okay
current events
you 've got the question you can go first there since i called
i rely primarily on newspaper combined with television
that
you 're the opposite of me
i drive an hour each way to work
if i just use time
not say one which quality is the best
i guess that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio
newspapers and t v would be tied after that because maybe i 'll catch the evening news like ten o'clock on t v
i
that 's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper
okay
i really
of course you 're in a different part of the country
i really listen to a lot of the talk shows i do n't mean the gossip ones
there 's a lot
on the weekends when i do chores or whatever
i 'm a radio hound i guess
i take the radio with me when i 'm working on my car the lawn or whatever
turn on
they have everything from lawn work lawyers news veterinarians all kinds of items
a real radio buff especially when i 'm doing chores
that 's rather interesting
yeah
i find it surprising because a lot of times it here
i 'll talk to some people here
i 'll mention some talk host
i 'll expect them to have an opinion on why i do n't like him and do n't listen
they do n't even know what the guys name is bruce williams who does financial work all over the united states
most people have n't heard of bruce williams
you probably have n't either unless you 're a radio buff
i 'd have to say i have n't either
he is in new jersey and is entrepreneur and kind of a self-made millionaire
he has it
i
it 's five seventy here
i 'm trying to
it 's on cliff
i do n't know what the
he 's on all stations
you might remember the name bruce williams
he is again national and talks about a lot of financial things
the here i just get a kick out of
we do a lot of gardening here
there 's
we have an excellent gardener here
has three hours on sunday and three hours on saturday
of course that 's not exactly current events
i 'm i am kind of a radio buff
i listen to the radio probably five or six hours a week
almost inevitably to a station that is a classical station here for music purposes
for music
we do n't use the radio as a wake up
we have a television connected to a electronic alarm system that kicks in
yeah
it comes on with c n n in the morning
yeah
that 's good
that
we wake up to television news and shower and dress and whatever to that
because of the fact that my wife and i ride to work together in a car we chat at each other rather than something else
that 's good
occasionally what we 'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in the car
we have the advantage of being able to read and drive although there seems to be from what i 've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving
my wife always wonders about that
she says look at that person he 's driving and reading at the same time
we rely pretty heavily i think on a combination of the two
i also use newsweek magazine
yeah
we tend to alternate between newsweek and time and whatever happens to be the news magazine of the year for us
right
we get
i read sporadically of commentary and a couple of other trade magazines such as that where i might read the the occasional social and even current event commentaries and everything as diverse as a c m to some of the other tabloids i get
i guess i use about eighty percent written is probably my input and twenty percent television i think i respect from a journalistic perspective current events
i 've always said that it 's really not interesting unless it 's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline
good point
that 's a good point
other than that it was a at best
yeah
it comes and goes
we 're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in raleigh
there are other
i 'm not sure what you would call them the small competing independent sort of newspapers
little small weekly things
there 's only one daily called the news and observer fondly referred to here by some as the sometimes the noise and observer
yeah
it depends
it has decent national coverage but has an extremely focused political coverage probably steeped in the southern history and the fact that this is a democratic state
local you mean
consequently everything is filtered through that republican democratic sort of glass almost unnecessarily
yeah
yeah
do n't they have city council meetings and all that
are you into any of that what 's going on in the city council and the school boards and all that
we have that addition to our paper
yeah
we have
that is
as a matter of fact they update it once a week with a special section
we pay it sort of glancing nod
we have a very good friend who is tapped into the city planning structure our developer architect friend
you get it from people then
right
i think we find out what 's happening in the city on a fairly frequent basis over a gin and tonic sort of thing
yeah
right
that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of raleigh than the paper would have anyway
my wife and i as mentioned
the question was do you get it from people too
i can say the same thing you do that my wife she reads the paper from front to back
she 'll tell me some stuff
she 'll always get mad and say you did n't read the
i always read the sports
what am i thinking of the commentaries
i ca n't even think of what it is offhand
she 's always reading something
she says why have n't you read that
i say i never have time to read it like you do
i always get a lot of my information from the newspaper through her
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess we do get it from people too
you mentioned c n n of course i mentioned radio and the c n n t v news
uh-huh
it 's the same thing that 's on the radio word for word
is that right heard there was some stuff on the radio that was equivalent to c n n
yeah
okay
it
because
we have it here at work as a matter if fact at t i
okay
we have it in the break area c n n
the reason i say that is on the radio they 'll say look at this
when i first heard c n n it only started about since the war or right before that
they would always say look at this
there would be a pause would be music and stuff
i realized that it 's the exact commentary that you have on the the news
that did n't
yeah
yeah
it 's still good
it 's still
you do n't really miss anything
uh-huh
i do enjoy since the gulf war listening to c n n radio too as well as watching c n n on t v here at work
i do n't have c n n at home
let me turn this radio off
i 'm at work right now believe it or not
where was i
i 'm
go ahead
your turn
we probably were listening to c n n fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began
we almost live and breathed it because during the war itself to the point where we began to sort of have household pact of lets turn the war off and get something done
yeah
i 've heard that
yeah
almost an addition
we could equate or relate relay well to some of the newspaper and television articles about the fact that people where having this problem in uncoupling from the events and going on with their
right
instead of watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever
because of that we began towards the middle of the war i guess about two and a half or three weeks in we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would watch fifteen minutes before fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news or our local news
we would watch c n n until six thirty then we would watch a rotating network news of a b c c b s n b c
we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one
right
we would turn the television off
we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on news that way
we would do a similar thing at ten forty-five because c n n would be wrapping their hourly coverage up
we would get the local coverage
i think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would have better state coverage rather than local coverage
three of the networks here on their local news
that
if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who murdered who or stole what from whom
yeah
that was the sort of thing that i would say is the best ( ( mumblex
) ) not news
yeah
unless there 's some trend or something that says this neighborhood has been hit forty-seven times or whatever that 's sort of more of a pattern news
i never get home early enough for those five and six o'clock
okay
what do you think of the public school system
first off do you have children that are in it
i have children that are in the plano public school systems
i am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school system
okay
then you should be a good one to know because my children are grown now
i now have grandchildren in the school system
oh
i do n't have firsthand experience right now with it
uh-huh
uh-huh
what do you think
i think the public school systems are doing a good job
i think they have a long way to go yet
i think that they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier
you know my kindergartners were on the computers
i think that with the way the world is today that 's got to be done
i think that the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them skills
right
you figure out why you 're adding it and what you 're going to do with it once you 've got it together
i think that that 's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids can not think
they literally can not come in out of the rain
that 's right
that just
i do n't care how intelligent you are if you be can not make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted
right
this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why i went into education
i think they 're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have
i think that 's very very important
yes
it is
i agree with you that they 're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren
we have a fourth grader
we have one that 's in kindergarten
i know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children were doing in the fifth and sixth grade
yeah
yeah
i tutor a girl that 's in eighth grade
her pre-algebra book is higher then some of my algebra two when i was in high school
is that scary
it 's like i going to take this home and study it before i can help you
right
they 're really moving them along
yet at the same time they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life
that 's wha-
a lot of the things that we did in school i 've never used and never will use
yes
i think that it 's appropriate to teach them why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this
correct
are you finding that since you 're doing substitute that you 're wanting to do full-time
i have a friend that 's a teacher that one of her complaints is she ca n't teach because she 's so busy filling out all the forms
yes
that 's a
d-
do you find that
filling out the forms and also all of these statewide and national wide testing things so that they compare
uh-huh
as far as i 'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say
uh-huh
it 's just a matter of how you 're going to interpret it
you waste so much time quote unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they 're possibly going to be that i think it 's crazy personally
be
uh-huh
the whole first nine weeks of school is used as a review
more than a review they 're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in october so that you know your school district shines throughout the united states
coming up
uh-huh
i think that 's totally useless
i think there 's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons
i think they 've taken it to the extent now that it 's just ridiculous
it 's like bragging on your grandchildren
right
everybody 's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth
nobody else 's children are going to ever live up to this
that 's great
that 's what they 're doing with the school systems
they 're wasting too much time on that i think
i know that this friend is in the plano school district
uh-huh
she teaches emotionally disturbed children
uh-huh
she says she has six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade
yes
because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they 're passed on or something
i did n't quite understand it
yeah
there 's a
yeah
the bottom line is always money
in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that i know and lawyers and whatnot i think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem
do you
why
why
if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students so they could become doctors the problem would go away
you think the problem is not enough doctors
i think the problem is that the doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor you are going to pay high premiums on your liability
gosh for one thing
oh
uh-huh
you think there are plenty of doctors
yeah
i do n't think there is a shortage of doctors
i do know that o b which is my field the doctors ' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year that deliver babies
uh-huh
it 's astronomical
they ca n't doing anything about that
i do n't think they 're in a conspiracy
i think it 's our fault because we as people just sue them
no
people do n't sue
people are very sue conscious
lawyers sue
if you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor
yeah
that 's probably true too
people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days
sure
when you think about reasonableness i believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory
you know what tort theory is
no
a tort is when you do something wrong
right
it
an o b g y n doctor can not control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent
that 's right
if the baby is born dead that happens
if they have complications and
it depends
i know there are guys that are real slobs
there are also people out there that are really doing their job
that 's true
they are because doctors are performing many more tests
many of them are unnecessary
they are doing so many c sections just to prevent
just to prevent a a law suit
they have all these monitors now
if anything looks even a little bit funny their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby
yeah
{ c and so } it 's costing more all around in health insurance for tests for surgery for longer hospital stay
yeah
uh-huh
i believe that there is a system already in place for health care
it 's terrible
uh-huh
they have indigent health care
you show up at parkland bleeding
you 'll get it
that 's true
in fact you 'll get it at presbyterian if you show up there too
yeah
we have that happen
we have patients that go through parkland through the clinic
uh-huh
at the last minute they come to us we ca n't turn them away
uh-huh
yeah
i think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation the problem would pretty much evaporate
yeah
i 'm for that
i 've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer i 'd like to wipe them all out
yeah
i happen to know a few
i even claim one as a friend
he 's a divorce attorney
he better not be mine
i think he 'll go nameless for the purposes of this conversation
i also know an o b g y n who has stopped practicing
yeah
some they do
he just said
they stop their o b at least
yeah
he 's not going to deliver any more babies ever
right
right
his malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year
that 's incredible
he said he had to gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice
yeah
most of them are very sincere
most of them do the best they can
yeah
they are human
occasionally something will go wrong
you can be human and catholic
i know you can be human and catholic
you 're not likely to find somebody who is going to have a less conscientious effort
yeah
no
most of them do
i really believe that
from dealing with doctors dealing with lawyers there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious
who is getting rich
insurance companies
yeah
they are
if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance
say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed
greg
i 'm not familiar
i think you guys in indiana do n't you have the death penalty
yeah
we do have the death penalty here
it 's not exercised very often
we do have it
uh-huh
i believe it
uh-huh
i know there 's a lot of problems with it seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that the person i feel does n't deserve to live does n't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in prison for life
uh-huh
right
i know there 's a lot of problems with that like they say if you put them on death row and execute them then ten years later you find out that he really did n't do it then that life was wasted just seems like in some cases that it 's a good policy
uh-huh
uh-huh
i tend to agree with you
i 've changed my views even within the last few years to be honest
when i was an undergraduate i was a member of amnesty international
uh-huh
of course at that time i thought it was stupid to kill anybody for
that
the eye for an eye was a stupid argument
right
the the more
now i live in downtown dallas i 've seen i 've seen cases in the news and all where a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder
right
right
i think that maybe a good solution to capital punishment might be reserve it solely for repeat offenders of a crime like murder
that 's a thought that i had never really had on that which seems pretty sensible
yeah
it seems sensible and failsafe
i i do n't
not completely failsafe
if a man 's convicted of two murders there 's a pretty good chance that something 's wrong
right
i also
to tell you how liberal i have turned toward this or or whatever side that is i 've kind of chosen i believe it that big time drug importers like noriega for example that these people need to be eliminated from society
right
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because really any kind of jail sentence for them is just another chance to create another power structure
yeah
you 're right there
i gue-
basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they 're going to be there for life they 're never going to be rehabilitated
uh-huh
right
right
i do n't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with
right
to me i 'm paying taxes twenty percent of my check or whatever to keep somebody alive who i in my mind should n't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society
uh-huh
i 'm all in favor of it
uh-huh
do you
are there cases where you think that the capital punishment should n't be sentenced
i really do n't know on that question
it just seems like
for instance the jeffrey dahlmer case i do n't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society
i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
uh-huh
in that case wisconsin does n't have a death penalty
he 's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
right
i think that he should not be allowed to live
then you 're kind of playing god which is never a good thing to do
that 's true
yeah
right
cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld not really that i can think of
i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers
uh-huh
uh-huh
i do n't really agree with the death penalty for people like noriega and such as that
i think that they 're operating on a more
i know that they 're causing massive problems in society up here
i do n't really think that it 's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you do n't deserve to live because they 're feeding our consumer needs
right
sure
yeah
i understand your point
yeah
of course with with dahlmer now you realize that i think it 's ohio gets to try him next they do have the death penalty
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
that was a curious case
i
yeah
that is very curious
something is sort of nightmarish to say the least
yeah
that 's right
here in texas we
i think even this last week they had another they
they use their capital punishment by lethal injection
okay
first how much television watching do you do
i do a little bit more than i think usual people do because i am here alone during the day
uh-huh
i like it just for the noise
that 's right
do you actually watch it pay attention to it
is it more of a company
it just depends on what it is
uh-huh
i have my favorite things that i do
uh-huh
okay
some fun thing to do sometime
right
what about you
i work full time
when i am not working i am running
i do not watch a lot of television
i am very selective in what i watch
right
if there 's something that i absolutely want to watch i will turn it on and watch it and then turn it off
i probably watch television four hours a week max
that 's great
yeah
if i do not find something that i really want or really want to watch then i just do not turn it on
i would rather listen to music
right
part of it is that i think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis
i think that if we are doing other things and these programs come in sometimes they influence us
we do not know where that influence came from
i think that 's partially true too
yeah
i think you have to have the will and the
i think it
right
right
right
you would be susceptible to stuff
of course i
it has to be reinforced at another level too
that 's
do you like specials
last night for example i really would have liked to have watched unsolved mysteries
those are fascinating to me
oh
if i have the opportunity i watch it
unfortunately i was with someone else who was flipping channels
oh
i hate that
i do not care a whole lot for some of the contemporary humor
right
yeah
in our comedy programs although
nobody can appreciate comedy any more than i can
i would prefer to find a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians
we have cable also
uh-huh
sometimes you can get the h b o specials
sometimes those are really pretty hysterical
uh-huh
i like to watch comedy
uh-huh
that 's something
i enjoy comedy
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess i have my old favorites
uh-huh
bob newhart is still on
uh-huh
i watch him
i enjoy that
uh-huh
something on that level
uh-huh
i also enjoy
i do not know
sunday mornings it 's channel thirteen
i watch a lot of thirteen the mclaughlin group i just laugh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's right
i think that 's so hysterical these guys
uh-huh
it 's just so much fun
it 's just a lot of fun watching that
uh-huh
i do not agree with a whole lot of the stuff the they say
right
right
yeah
i like to be entertained
i really do
yeah
i watch it for entertainment
i also watch it for cultural impact
i do a lot of channel thirteen channel three some of the educational channels
i watch for special programs that have a special play a special concert
i recently watched a tribute to three of the finest opera stars
that was fabulous
it was fabulous
that
i was just absolutely
yeah
you just held you breath in some of those
yeah
yeah
i was just
it makes chills all over you
i know
i may or may not even look at the t v guide
if i have time i may flip through and say this looks good if i finish this task i can watch that in an hour
if the hour comes and i do not get a chance to watch it so what
there 's certain thin-
uh-huh
i have got my t v in the kitchen here
uh-huh
i love to watch cooking shows
i really do
i do too
it makes me want to cook
i know
i eat
i get fat
i just let other people watch
i
yeah
then i eat what they cook
there 's some
in fact one of the water color shows i know has inspired me to take water color lessons
i think that 's marvelous
yeah
yeah
i took a lot of my college courses
i took some of my college courses on television
yeah
that
it 's very successful for some of those things
oh
i think i really got stung very badly about having influence in your life
at least i saw a very bad example of having television influence your life
my husband had an aunt who was addicted to soaps
uh-huh
i want you to know that became the most suspicious cantankerous contrary old woman ever walked
she got you a
absolutely
i do not know who she thought she was
she just got to the point where you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice and that attitude being demonstrated
yeah
for her to miss a soap it was a big withdrawal
that 's
she was probably depressed to begin with
i do not know
you know what i mean
she was grumpy to begin with
yeah
grumpy to begin with
yeah
there 's no doubt about that
you could clearly see those influences in my youngsters
uh-huh
i know that one day my youngsters were watching the three stooges
i always thought that was just casual slap stick comedy
i hate that show
when one tries to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench i decided that was not funny any more i really feel very strong about the bart simpson show
yeah
i
good
i think that is
the kids watch that
that 's absolutely the mouthiest kid i ever saw
i do not like it
is not that amazing
how old are your kids
mine are grown
i have grandchildren and young children around
okay
that 's
yeah
for a four year old to think bart simpson is a hero is tragic
i had forgotten about that
it 's just my husband and i of the kids shows and all that
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i do n't know
i was very careful even when my kids were at home
yeah
when they were young i really did watch what they watched
i was cau-
i sat down with them
i watched it
if i did not like it i changed the channel for them
right
right
i just wou-
we get it at school too
you might as well not reinforce it
sure
that 's right
that 's right
gosh
they are mouthy enough anyway
i remember going to sch-
my parents were a lot like too
uh-huh
kids all the watch rawhide and all those shows
uh-huh
uh-huh
my parents never let me watch anything like that
i could watch yogi bear
uh-huh
what kind of culture was that
yeah
i remember going to school the next day
everybody would be asking did you see that did you see how he did that
uh-huh
did you see
i could never participate
uh-huh
it always made me feel a little bit a loner
i
sure
i can understand how that would happen
then my parents
absolutely
i did
to
i ran my kids to death
i said i think that 's enough television for awhile
really
maybe we need to go outside
yeah
we need to go out and play and enjoy some company
i would go out with them
there 's the problem parents do not do that
they say you go outside and play
that 's true
you go rent a video up at the store and come home and sit down and watch it
yeah
i said
we did other things
i think that was
that 's something people do not do
here we are talking on that subject
that 's an interesting concept
i have got to stick in my
of course
work with kids
okay
do you participate in family reunions
i did for years
i do n't have enough family left to have them
uh-huh
did you
were they far away
were they close
i come from a family that was very large in bell county
uh-huh
my grandfather came to bell county on a covered wagon and had ten children
how neat
sometimes we would have a reunion with that group
uh-huh
sometimes we would go to arkansas where they came from and have a reunion with the entire group
that would be fun
yeah
it was a lot of fun
yeah
we have a family reunion on my mother 's side of the family that 's
it started probably about forty years ago because i remember going as a teenager before i was ever married
my husband and i went while we were still dating
it 's still going on
it used to be held at lake brownwood down at brownwood texas
now we hold it at lake texoma so that the oklahoma group does n't have to drive as far
uh-huh
we have had as many on a saturday night
it starts on friday and goes through sunday
we 've had as many on a saturday night as about two hundred and fifty
we would have group like that in arkansas
uh-huh
we 'd have two hundred and fifty or three hundred
yes
we took
our family all brought in food and everything
many of us came from a long way that we 'd usually at a motel
we bought food there
uh-huh
uh-huh
i know on sundays we all elect now to chip in
we go get kentucky fried chicken and bring out
uh-huh
we kind of take our food for three days
now our grandchildren are participating in it just love that they have all this little batch of cousins that they get to see about once a year
uh-huh
uh-huh
enthused and with it
our children thoroughly enjoy it
right
it 's been kind of nice
it started out when i was a youngster and watching my mother
now i 'm to the mother was
uh-huh
i am now the older generation and doing more of the cooking and watching my daughter more and everything
uh-huh
it 's something i really miss because i had twenty-seven first cousins
my word
we were very close family
our father 's generation was enough older than i
my father would be a hundred now that they 're all dead
uh-huh
in fact many of my first cousins are dead
are they
of course they have their own families and grandchildren and all that
we very rarely all of us get together
get together any more
we 're a long way away
the younger generation the next like my cousin 's children i do n't know very well
uh-huh
uh-huh
it
it 's
i doubt that that will come to be again
as long as my oldest aunt lived we we got together once a year
i do think now we have noticed a waning of interest
as parents get older and start dying off i think sometimes it is hard to keep the interest going
folks have gotten so mobile
i have a son and a daughter and two nephews that are grown and a brother who has a new marriage and a younger son
uh-huh
my brother and his wife live in nevada my daughter lives in colorado one of my nephews lives in new york city one nephew lives in memphis and my son lives here
uh-huh
i think it 's very unlikely we 'll have a family reunion
yeah
you probably do good just to get your immediate family together
yeah
i 'm divorced
really only immediate family i have left is my
i have a son and a daughter
uh-huh
uh-huh
my family 's really all dead
uh-huh
it was great pleasure while we did it
yeah
they 're a lot of fun
my si-
i have a sister
we have a son and a daughter
we have three grandchildren
uh-huh
our son and daughter are both married
our son 's not as interested in it as our daughter
our daughter is really interested
does it bother you if your children are not interested in it
i beg you pardon
does it bother you if your children are not interested in it
a little bit
i wish that our son was
uh-huh
the cousins are closer to our daughter 's age than to our son 's and just totally different interest group
plus
he 's newly married and does n't have children
uh-huh
i 'm hoping that as they are married a little bit longer and have children that they may be more inclined to want to go to it
uh-huh
i know that
what kinds of things do you do to try to get your children interested
just talk to them about it
talk to them about it and tell them some of the things we 're doing
when he was a preteen when he was like ten or twelve he loved going
uh-huh
he had another cousin he was close to and went
that cousin kind of quit going
as he got to be a teenager he was n't quite as interested
he was more interested in rock and roll
this is more country western group
uh-huh
just lack of interest
okay
what 's it been doing up there
it 's real dry up here
really
yeah
we need rain really bad
oh
all the farmers
th-
it 's good for hay
you know all the farmers got their first cut of hay and everything
they 're going to need some rain to get the second cut
oh
i 'm working for a lady who has a strawberry field
if we do n't have rain she 's going to lose a lot of money
my goodness
we have been drenched
oh
we have had so much rain for may and june that we 've got all the weather people down here really confused
my
we
it 's probably
it 's just
it 's usually dry down there is n't it
yeah
right now
by now it 's usually
no
it 's quit raining by at least a month
uh-huh
it 's still
we 're still having april showers for june
i hope they come this way
yeah
i do n't know where it came from
it 's been really
we got a lot of
we 're in central texas
it feels like we live in houston
really
yeah
it it
it rained today
it just kind of steamed everything up
uh-huh
it 's been great because we have n't had to use our sprinkler system
we 've had some with really really high winds that have trashed trees and everything else
my
it 's just
everyone up here with their gardens they 're not going to have much of a garden this year because it 's so dry
yeah
i hope you get some of that
yeah
we got enough
we have had plenty
we 're still forecast for more
really
yeah
gee
is california getting rain then
i 'm not real sure
i think a lot of this is coming out of
i think what 's happen- of
it 's coming out of canada
out of the gulf
it 's meeting what 's coming out of the gulf
oh
it 's just causing chaos
yeah
it 's been wet
uh-huh
we 've moved our yard i think three or four times in the last two or three weeks
my gosh
just because it just keeps growing and growing and growing
one week it just rained thunderstormed for a day straight
you could n't get out there
uh-huh
you just could n't get out there
by the time you finally got out there where your lawn mower would n't sink we were
yeah
lawn mower broke
now we need
we could use two days straight of rain
oh
it 's really drying up here
what always works for me is if i water my plants or we wash the car it usually rains
if not that night the next day
does it
i was telling everyone hang your clothes out on the line
it 's surely going to rain
yeah
yeah
whenever you hang your clothes out on the line it always rains
yeah
uh-huh
we 've had real hot weather
hotter than usual
yeah
yes
we
let me think
i got out of school in may
in march i was wearing shorts
wow
i was wearing shorts in march up at college
we w-
what they said is that this area has had its summer weather in the spring
is what they said what happened
i hope that
i do n't know
i hope that does n't mean we 're going to get an early winter
no
i would n't think so
i would n't
not as early as it came
your talking september maybe
yeah
that 's a little early
still the
uh-huh
yeah
i was wearing shorts in march
you know it was nippy
uh-huh
it was still in the seventies
yeah
high sixties low seventies in march
yeah
we were in new jersey last october
uh-huh
it was hotter there than it was here
yes
it was just like a heat wave
uh-huh
yeah
we have n't
we just died
my gosh
it was really hot i like it here
i would n't trade it for snow any day
really
yeah
i like the snow
i like to watch it fall
i just like it where it 's deep enough but not too deep
right
i can handle a vacation in it
my husband is from new jersey
he would n't go back either
he did all the shoveling and everything else
really
he said it was a pain
is n't it weird at christmas time without snow
no
i do n't think so
see last year we had snow at christmas time
oh
it was weird because we had snow
it 's like wow it actually fell on the right day
no
it 's not
in fact we 're used to running around in spring clothes in december
when it throws in a real cool winter we get broken pipes and all that kind of stuff because texas just is n't built for real cold weather for long periods of time
yeah
it 's real dry down there
you do n't have the humidity either do you
no
not were we are
now in houston and stuff they 've got it where no hairsprayer works
it 's so humid at times
here it 's just about right
it 's pretty dry and not too dry where it hurts to breathe we 're just about right
uh-huh
yeah
we 're just having all this rain
late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable
made the humidity real high
yeah
muggy huh
no
i like it
we 're right in a good stop because we get over the hundreds in the summer
uh-huh
it 's not it 's a dry heat
it 's not really as hot and muggy as it would be being over a hundred plus ninety percent humidity
yeah
that 's what 's bad up here is when we do get the real hundred and the high nineties we have the humidity to go with it
oh
you 're real mucky
you
your legs stick together just from walking
yeah
yeah
i know what
we like it where we 're at
if it 's not a whole bunch of everything at once type stuff
uh-huh
yeah
no
it 's interesting when it gets really cold here
people forget that they 're live in texas
they do n't know how to drive in snow i would n't trade it for anything
that 's good
i was born in texas
i visited other areas
i 'm just a sun person i think
i 've gotten used to it
i do n't know
i guess that 's really about all
yeah
weather is not real hard to talk about
it does n't last real long either
i thought the weather is the last thing you talk about
in this case it 's the only thing to talk about
michelle it 's great talking to
okay
i guess first of all i 'll just say we have n't done much gardening
we do lawn work all the time
our gardening we lost
remember the last two freezes
i do n't know how long you 've been here
yeah
i do
we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones
as far as our bushes we do n't have any
we do have some blackberry bushes they were really hearty and stayed on
really
we 've done really well with them
did you plant those yourself
uh-huh
yeah
oh
they 've been really good
the kids i had to
the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries
we go out
it 's hard to go out when it 's this hot
uh-huh
keep the weeds out of them and keep them off the ground so the ants do n't eat them
they 're okay
oh
yeah
that 's nice
i love blackberries
we
when i was smaller my family lived in tennessee
there used to be wild blackberries that we 'd go out and pick my brother and i
i do n't have any down here
yeah
yeah
we have some flowers that have
they 're just are real hearty also
they 're bold
they come up every year
they 're getting too thick
i need to go thin them out
i do n't know what kind of flowers they are
they 're real common around here
they 're orange
they look like a lily sort of
i think i know what they
i ca n't remember what the name of them are either
no
i think they 're real pretty when it rains because their petals do n't soak the rain in
they keep the rain on the outside little rain drops
oh
they look real pretty after the rain
i really like them
i need to get out and do that
as far as our grass it grows crazy here
it just keeps growing and growing
sometimes my son does it
it just is
i do n't know
i 've lived in utah my whole life
we ca n't seem to get ours green
i do n't know
down here the grass
yeah
i 'm
we 've had problems with our yard
we
it was one big weed is what it was
uh-huh
it was just horrible
my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns
we have this god awful ugly thing i know they must think i wish those people would do something about their yard
crappy i know
we have that too
my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff that seems to be helping
he put it on the front yard to see how it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard
uh-huh
we 've got a great dane in the back
uh-huh
she has eaten everything i have put out there
she 's eaten my crepe myrtle trees
dear
i know
she 's eaten the bushes
i 've tried to i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there
no
i barricaded it up so she could n't get into it
uh-huh
i went and took a shower and looked back out there
she was already in it
i was so mad
had somehow gotten in
i ca n't do anything back
yeah
yeah
i 've tried out in the front
like you said that freeze that came
uh-huh
i had some shrubs i put out front
it killed those too
i 'm just real discouraged with the whole thing
i just do n't even want to do anything
the other problem that we have
it 's funny because the two bushes on the ends of the house that i think are ugly they lived
i do n't know
yeah
that happened to us
we have these
i wanted to go out and kill them too
i know
they had no right to live
anyway under our trees we get a north sun
the
it looks like our trees do n't have any grass under them
i know
ours do n't
we just ca n't grow grass underneath there
i know
we ca n't either
i 've got two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard one on either side of the yard
uh-huh
they 're big
they 're real full and everything in the summer time
it 's killing everything underneath where the leaves are shading the tree
yeah
toward the end of the summer when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing
by then it 's so late then the winter comes and it stops
it 's it 's a never ending cycle
right
it 's a vicious cycle is n't it
yeah
it really is
it just really
we 've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and whatnot
i do n't
we 've never done anything like this
we 've been thinking if we built up a wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some flowers some new bushes in there that would live
uh-huh
i think that we 're going to try that
huh
i i think that 's pretty much what we have decided
i have two long windows
yeah
really
c-
i do n't really have to worry about that that much because my sons ' bedrooms are in the front
they 've got mini-blinds and stuff
yeah
only one is really in the flower bed part
the other one is out on the porch
yeah
there 's not really much i can do about that
that 's what our two rooms are on the front too with these long windows
one is a bedroom for our oldest son
one is an office that my husband and i work in
i really do n't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that
the flowers are out by the back of the house
that 's why the front room is
that 's not too bad
yeah
i like to look at the flowers
they 're pretty
i do too
that 's why i look at my neighbors yard
yeah
i do n't have anything to look at
i look at theirs
it 's funny because you try so hard i think sometimes to to do our yard
uh-huh
it 's like the wind blows everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them
yeah
even if you did get it under control it seems like in just a few months it would all be back
yeah
it 's really a pain
my husband works a lot
a lot
it 's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work
yeah
i 'm
it 's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard i really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it
uh-huh
i hate to mow the yard more than anything else
i hate to mow that yard
i know
it 's not my favorite thing in the world either
i 'm glad i have an old enough son to do it for me now
yeah
mine 's getting there
he helps
he does half
i do half
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
that is one chore that we will pay him for if he 'll go do the yard work out outside
sure i 'll be more then glad to pay him if he 'd just go out there and do it and do it to where i do n't have to go back out and redo it
right
exactly
that 's my only thing with him
exactly
that 's why i 'm having him help me now
i think you got it
okay
my first thoughts on capital punishment i-
i
the first thing i want to say is no just simply because we as human beings do n't have the right to take another human being 's life
uh-huh
we are punishing someone for taking someone 's life
in some cases we are punishing a person for taking someone 's life
in effect we are committing that same crime
it sounds like you have really strong views on it
uh-huh
i can see that point
i also have this
i question
i guess i can look at it both ways
just to play devil 's advocate it never seems right to me that we take in people that are criminals and people that are low income or even middle income that are struggling to provide for their families
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
our taxes are paying to feed and shelter those people
ac-
it just
that i find very difficult to swallow sometimes
uh-huh
one thing i do n't understand is the whole concept of death row
uh-huh
okay
these people are supposedly i guess waiting to die
right
i 'm with you there
okay
there are thousands upon thousands of people on death row
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'm not saying that
i guess i am kind of saying what are we doing
i guess that 's the same thing you were saying
what are we doing with these people
ha-
they 're there
we should take some kind of action take enough go a different route
right
exactly
they 're just
when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs we could be poor people and helping the environment
exactly
uh-huh
prison is such a waste of a human being
uh-huh
it does n't do anyone any good
exactly
yes
people need to be punished
uh-huh
i do agree with your statement that to take a human life is wrong
right
act-
locking someone up and not getting any benefit from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too
uh-huh
i guess i see both sides in that at the same time that i 'm saying that we 're committing the same crime
uh-huh
i also agree that if there is somebody out there that 's crazy and cruel enough to kill somebody or in some cases kill several people at one time
uh-huh
exactly w-
there was a case in dallas
i 'm sure they have n't gone to court yet
apparently two teenage boys held up a taco bell
they put four people in a freezer and shot them all
to me that is inhumane
for two people to be out in the world like that i do n't want them in my world
that 's right
you understand what i am saying
that 's right
i 'm i 'm not for killing anyone
uh-huh
i do n't want these people around at the same time
we want a safe environment for ourselves
we want to remove them
exactly
i think that the whole crux of the problem is no one has come up with a solution that is acceptable that does basically
uh-huh
right
i think that the whole idea of the death penalty was invented for two reasons
it removes them from society
right
you want to appease the people that have suffered
right
it really does n't take their pain away
uh-huh
at the same time like you said it drains society
uh-huh
it 's a
we
i think we should be
we
the same money that we 're using to build more prisons and make more prison space and keep these people in prison that same money or half of that money could be used towards rehabilitation programs of some sort
something to put these people back in society
right
prepare them first
exactly
that
the problem is so incredibly complex
i have a friend who works on the pardon and paroles
she interviews inmates all the time that are coming up for parole
uh-huh
uh-huh
she says it is just really frightening how easy it is to have the prisons release people because they 're overcrowded
exactly
these people have not benefited from the stay there
she says just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong
uh-huh
there 's not anything she can do to keep them in if they meet certain guidelines
uh-huh
right
those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work
it 's
uh-huh
you want people out of prison
you want people to get jobs and live happy lives
uh-huh
they ca n't just walk out of prison and do that
they ca n't just walk out of prison and say i 'm going to go a different route
that 's right
that 's right
there has to be some sort of buffer in there
uh-huh
some sort of program or
i know this costs money
it could n't cost any more money than we 're already spending
i know
i know
i would like to see the money that 's been budgeted for new prisons being put into the research of alternate solutions to the problem
uh-huh
how are we going to fix that tanya
how are we going to make that happen
how
what can we do
what power do we have
goodness
everyone 's trying to make it in their own little world
uh-huh
i 'm trying to make it with my job and make myself okay and make my family okay
that 's right
it 's so hard to try and be one of the movers and shakers i guess you would call them
really
i know
i know
uh-huh
it sounds like you are interested in what 's going on around you
uh-huh
yes
when you have a voice you do contribute
i guess that 's what we 're meant to do
right
maybe an opportunity will come by that we will have a chance to make a real change
uh-huh
i 'm a broadcast journalist
i feel like one day i probably will write a book or something
some of these views will be able to come out
where do you work
i work at channel six here
i 'm a news reporter
you do
that 's great
i guess i 'm pretty emotional about crime things like that now
i 've only been in it for a year
i get to see pretty much close up a lot of things that happen that people do n't see
uh-huh
i get to see a lot of crimes
exactly
i get to see people 's pain and things
when we talk about
uh-huh
most of us are so sheltered
yeah
a few people in the news that bring it to us and make us see what 's out there
exactly
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's
you 're really performing a benefit to society in doing that
a service
yeah
still we ca n't
i do n't know
i guess i would like to probably editorialize more
we have to just report what 's happening
we ca n't say this is what i think about the situation
uh-huh
uh-huh
sometimes you really want to say that
you really want to say what you think should be done or how you think this court case should have gone
that 's a
i 'm just i 'm just agreeing with you when i think of it how difficult it must be to just to just give the facts because usually on an issue that you really care about you want to persuade people to your viewpoint
uh-huh
you 're right
that has got to be a challenge sometimes
especially when you are dealing with a subject like capital punishment or something or abortion or something where there 's an no or yes side
right
you have your side
uh-huh
you have to report both sides
right
you really do n't want to because you have your side
you have to walk right down the middle with it
yeah
yeah
yeah
sometimes that 's hard
i 'm sure
that sounds interesting
i 'll read your book sometime
that 's good
all right
it was nice talking to you
i enjoyed it
okay
thanks for calling
okay
bye bye
okay
i 've pressed the button
okay
let me tell you
i have n't been too many places
you have n't been to too many places
no
no
i have n't
okay
i have been to hawaii
that is where i want to go
that is where i have always wanted to go
i have never been there
it is beautiful
i know
is it
i had an aunt that lived there
she could n't stand it any more
she moved out because she said the whole island was being taken over by the japanese
there is a lot of japanese over there
they are
yeah
she also told me that
not her necessarily other people that have been there have said that it is too commercialized
uh-huh
is it
yeah
there is
it is commercialized
yeah
sure
i do n't think i have enough
oahu naturally has got more people on it than the other islands
uh-huh
it is still beautiful
you have got to see at least once
i will
eventually
what is the nicest island
i like maui
maui
i think that is what usually people say they do like the best
yeah
i like it because the beach is nice and white
it is like oahu
you can go over there and lay on the beach
uh-huh
yeah
kauai
the beaches are nice
i do n't know just not nice as maui
yeah
where have you been
i have been to california
i 've been to san francisco
you have
i loved it
i absolutely loved it
oh
yeah
how long ago
eighty-six
okay
my sister lives out there
my sister lives in piedmont
yeah
yes
uh-huh
that is right near piedmont
yeah
right
right
yeah
that is like a suburb or something whatever
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
okay
she was in berkley also
she
uh-huh
lets see i went when she was living
when i went out there she was in lafayette
she was living in lafayette
yeah
right
they moved to piedmont
uh-huh
i have n't seen her house in piedmont
i loved san francisco
i would like to go back
yeah
did you go on the cable cars and everything
yeah
yeah
is n't that fun
went to alcatraz
we did the whole bit
we went to the wine country
oh yeah
up by napa
yeah
yeah
beautiful
yeah
we went to carmel
uh-huh
we took the eighteen mile drive
is n't that pretty
i love it down there
it is beautiful
that is really beautiful
uh-huh
my girlfriend was down there a few months ago
first time she has been down there
they wanted to take that drive
they had closed the whole road because of fog
the weather
yeah
they never got to do that
i have also been to the carribean
i have n't been there either
you name it i have n't been there
i have been there a couple of times
uh-huh
i went on a cruise
that is nice
the last time i went i went with my two sisters
uh-huh
it was over christmas time
yeah
we really had a good time
uh-huh
they had this cruise director dress up like santa claus
we went to the beach
they had put a christmas tree on the beach decorated it up
uh-huh
it was a lot of fun
that 's nice
is a cruise nicer than if you just go to a hotel
yeah
it is
i have heard it is
yeah
yeah
you do n't have to worry about unpacking or anything like that
you put your clothes in your room
uh-huh
you will have to go on one
you do n't get seasick
that is what i am afraid of
no
no
there was
some people did on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in
uh-huh
that is unusual
yeah
one of my sisters got sick
the other one did n't
uh-huh
it is really nice
they just do so many things for you to make you enjoy the trip and everything
right
yeah
you will have to do that once
i want to go on another one
i want to go to alaska
yes
someone i know was on a cruise to alaska
uh-huh
uh-huh
was it to alaska
yeah
i am pretty sure
that is right my hairdresser
really
she went last year
she said she went on a cruise
i was thinking cruise i am thinking
on
she is laying on the beach
i said you are not very tan for someone who has been on a cruise
she said we went to alaska
yeah
right
that i would like to go
hawaii is number one
i would also like to go to australia
get a
i think i would like to too
yeah
i keep hoping to win the lottery where i can do all these things
i am just in the publisher 's clearing house and the reader 's digest because we do n't { f uh
} right now the lottery here
tell me about changes from say twenty years ago since you were an adult twenty years ago
let 's see we assume i was an adult twenty years ago
you 're able to you 're able to vote and go to war and things like that
yeah
definitely able to go to war twenty years ago but not vote
that 's right
that 's one of the changes
not vote
that was one of the changes that came about in the last twenty years
yeah
twenty years ago is nineteen seventy
nineteen seventy i had been married two years
uh-huh
we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixty-eight
uh-huh
around here on the east coast we were heavy into affirmative action
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
the problem was that my hair was too long
uh-huh
you were n't allowed to have a mustache or a beard if you wanted to get ahead with the company
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
if you were a black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months
if you were white male you 're talking six years
huh
that 's basically where i ended up
uh-huh
uh-huh
is the company now well represented demographically at the higher echelons
did it work
i think so
i i i stopped working for them in seventy-eight seventy-nine
uh-huh
it 's
i think they 're like all companies well represented
uh-huh
everything seems to be fine
uh-huh
i 've kind of lost touch with the company
we had a falling out
uh-huh
uh-huh
as far as their management goes i 'm not sure they 're any better off than they were before management wise
uh-huh
other changes just people seem to be more outspoken now individually rather than collectively
uh-huh
back in the seventies we had a lot of protests against the war and bring our troops home
things were more organized
uh-huh
i 've noticed that now more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i 'm not sure if that was because eighties was the me decade
the me decade
uh-huh
everybody was into me
we are getting back into us
it it 's
i 've seen a great deal of change as far as corporate responsibility and things
uh-huh
uh-huh
people 's response to that at first not trusting and now expecting more
uh-huh
uh-huh
what about the last ten years that you 've been aware
that i 've been aware of i 've
at least in my own circles i 've been aware of an increasing from my generation
i do n't know if i can quite call myself a distinct generation from you
half generation off i guess
i 've noticed a certain increase pessimism with america no longer being sort of on top
i had the impression
there was the quote unquote losing of the vietnam war which was a blow
it was right around that time when i started becoming a socially conscious adult
i realize that people of my age have no major success in the sense that you saw the passage of the civil rights act and major social change in that sense
i
all the changes that have happened in the last even during my adulthood have been more incremental
they 've been continual perhaps and good gains have been made
there has n't been the same sort of fiery speeches of martin luther king or whatever that has really galvanized the population
there 's just
instead there 's been sort of an increasing i do n't know japan bashing and things like that
uh-huh
a lot of
i see among some of my friends and even more among some of my students who are maybe twenty a real sense of america 's losing it
yes
losing it in the competitive market
a real knowl-
a lack of understanding how that could be in the sense that how could america have gone from being number one to possibly being number two
to
our former enemies and things like that
i see a lot of pessimism growing
at the same time i think there 's there 's a growing environmentalist movement and sense of corporate respon- increased corporate responsible towards environmental safety and things like that
that might potentially be sort of the civil right the equivalent of the civil rights act in the near future in terms of some real landmark bills passing and things like that
such that people
the thing about civil rights is people take it for granted now
my generation ca n't rest on the glow of having achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that there 's still some racism
basically things are
the assumption things are basically kind of taken care of
there 's a notion of fairness
yes
that 's
while still far from perfect is much more established i think
even i think along the line of the goals of civil rights there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone
uh-huh
of course
it 's human nature
do n't like the way you look do n't like the way you dress do n't like your hair do n't like it 's just something that always sets people off
you like someone you do n't like someone you 're just completely indifferent
yeah
yeah
the problem is that ideally the world would like you to be completely indifferent
i i understand what you say about the environmental movement
it 's been a long time coming
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i just
i 've seen a lot of changes from the original earth day
uh-huh
i 'm heavily involved in my own personal recycling
we recycle paper and cans here at work
uh-huh
uh-huh
i do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and all that stuff at home
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'm starting to see more and more recycling centers cropping up all over the place here on the east coast
uh-huh
right
that 's a real change except it sort of brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything else
yeah
like
all this recycling used to be in tact * [ [ typo in tact should be 'intact ' or not all of it
yeah
much of it did
recycling was a wartime thing
they turned around and called them junkyards and started making profits off them after the war
yes
yes
now we got to the point where the junkyards you 've got to pay them to take something there
uh-huh
things have really changed a lot
i think the other part about america 's decline i think has to do with
a perceived decline anyway yeah
yeah
the perceived decline has to do with the attitudes and the educational system
in i have three children in school right now
i 'm not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them
i had
when i was down in dallas for two years i had my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong and words spelled wrong not marked as such
uh-huh
yeah
this person 's teaching my children
uh-huh
i had a real problem with that
yeah
i 'd say as someone who 's involved in education i 'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society
relative pay which is a major way we value people has been poorer and poorer over the years
that
there 's been cost of living increases
not quite in proportion to cost of living
it 's just more and more a real low income sort of job and very low prestige
there 's that old saying those who can do it and those who ca n't teach
this is the way of let 's make fun of the teachers those are the people who ca n't do anything
yeah
if you have that kind of social attitude it 's hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay work for low social prestige just because they care about good education
yeah
you get more and more people and up there because it 's the safety net of those of average intelligence or something they can always teach
i 'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in maryland
they 're trying to get a a merit system here in maryland rather than a tenure system
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for puerto rico
i was a resident although very young of what is now the state of alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when alaska stopped being a territory and became a state
i guess i have a left over positive feeling about the question even though i do n't know very much about puerto rico
i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in alaska have been very positive
i have a suspicion that i believe that the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of puerto rico one ought to make it a full-fledged state let it go one or the other
what is your situation
i guess i do n't have such close experience with an area becoming a state as you do
my concern is the economy because as i understand it puerto rico has a very low standard of living or at least annual average income
part of this i suppose is justified in that the climate they do n't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need
however in that case i guess i would favor status quo
i have been to puerto rico and found it very very interesting
i did peace corps training there
that 's very interesting
i saw it also as a young student
it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in california
the spanish was no problem
it was very lovely
the people seemed very friendly and nice
i have
i work with a girl from puerto rico
i guess i have never thought to ask her what she favors
your concern on the economy was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on puerto rico or pressures on the u s in terms of aid
probably more in terms of the u s
i 'm not quite sure how the u s copes with this sort of thing
i 've live abroad most of my life
i guess i 've been very cut off
i lived actually in lebanon
i was very cut off from the press as i was becoming an adult
i do n't know how the u s would cope with a new state that is so very very poor
uh-huh
i guess we 'd have a lot of aid if you consider the inner cities of new york and how much aid it needs
i suppose the whole new state would require such aid
i guess we 're assuming that puerto rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than mississippi
i think so
okay
that 's something that i guess i have not much of an image of other than puerto rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess
although i 'm aware of the political problems and unrest and also difficulties they have i do n't know whether statehood would improve their economy
i do n't know that the act of being a state would have any impact on them
i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they do n't have now
of course if their economy is weak there is not much of a base on which to tax
i do n't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being since they are n't a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they are n't able to tax like a typical state would be
how do you feel though about
i guess it 's to their advantage to be a territory
i wonder how having been in a territory but only as a young student
my parents were in the military at the time
they did n't have ready negative feelings about being in alaska at the time since they voted absentee
i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a feeling of second class citizenry to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote
the district of columbia people for instance are quite frustrated i think at times in their not having a senate representative
uh-huh
yeah
those are good points which obviously i had never thought about
i do n't know i suppose they also not being a state are probably freer to determine their own ways of life than they would if
i 'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory
uh-huh
i see what you mean
that
yeah
taxes would undoubtedly be occurring
there
i do n't know i do n't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation
frequently the laws in a territory are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states
i
i 'm thinking in terms of education
then again each state sets its own
i do n't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like puerto rico
it 's interesting because i have n't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to economy i had thought of it more in terms of political realization
i guess i had automatically made the assumption that anyone would rather be a state of the u s than an independent country
uh-huh
i thin-
one one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they 've recently voted that spanish is the official language which i always assumed it was anyway
if they 've just taken such action it would seem to indicate to me they 're doing it because they 're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state maybe because they do n't want to become a state for fear of losing the spanish or hispanic heritage
uh-huh
that 's interesting too
it sounds as though you are in favor of status quo
i believe i would probably tend towards that
i think having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these
[ i 'm ul- i guess i 'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point towards the statehood
that 's interesting
right
what about if they demanded to have spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood
i think i would be troubled
i believe that any of our states
i
constitutionally i do n't think there are any prescriptions against that decision even if louisiana chose to go with creole or something
i do n't think there is any prohibitions
i would be bothered by that
i 'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of america 's strengths
that 's the the melting pot
uh-huh
i am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines
i 'm troubled by too close a clinging to the past
i 'm also realizing that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country
uh-huh
canada i guess comes to my mind as they 're going through the throes up there relative to french quebec and whatever
that i think that would be a negative step to make
i think that that they would need to reassess that
i 'm troubled even in by bilingualism in so far that it gets in the way of of the melting pot aspect
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's interesting because although i tend to be bilingual spanish based on experience i was in bilingual education in california
i did n't have any problem with my students
i noticed my brother who was quite a bit younger was learning spanish in elementary school
he ca n't speak a word
obviously it did n't work in california
yeah
i 'm rather in favor of people being bilingual
right
i 'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn english and a second language
right
i 'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level
i see
i 'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think we have gone to time
i appreciate your having called
okay
thank you very much
good-bye
bye
bye
what kind of house do you live in
we live in a one story just like a style home the standard texas fox and jacobs
yeah with a yard and fence
how about you guys
are you in a apartment or a home
i 'm in an apartment in plano
they say those are difficult to find
yeah
they are if
kind of depends on what you 're looking for
mine 's just a one bedroom place
that 's
how are rents doing
i have n't looked at rents in a long time
it 's hard for me to tell because i have n't rented in probably twenty twenty-five years
uh-huh
just
i 'm getting back into apartment life
it 's
what 's a one bedroom
are you in a
yeah
plano
most complexes in plano are pretty nice
you 're probably in a
they vary from place to place
it 's hard to tell how well they 've been kept up how old they are
uh-huh that does get high
these are probably one of the nicest that i found
they 're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place
yeah
yeah
it does considering that house payments are not a whole lot more than that
yeah
i was going to say our mortgage is between depending on
it drops
seems like in the last six months we got lucky
we refinanced
it
it was like eight hundred and something
it went down to like seven hundred and twenty
yeah
that 's really not
i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a town house in
that 's a lot for a townhouse
yeah
in
they 're near plano in north dallas too
i could n't believe it
that 's what happens when you get up in this area you got all these companies are up here
these
yeah
i guess they know they 're going to get it
i think that nobody was really buying houses there for a long time there because of just
we 've been in ours for about ten years
there 's no investment in it all it allows you to do is itemize on your taxes yeah
yeah
yeah
that 's true
you just take off your mortgage interest
that 's about it
that 's really about it
it 's
have you ever owned your own home
yeah
i 've owned several built several
you know what it 's like
yeah
it 's like when you first
this is our third one
it 's not
it 's not that exciting after a while
especially around north dallas or at least in plano area they basically all look alike because fox and jacobs
yeah
suburban tract
yeah
we lived out of state for a while and came back
we lived in a smaller city
now we say dallas really is big and polluted
is n't it
i can remember
i 've only been here eight years
i can remember coming to work from
i used to live in wylie
uh-huh
i could see downtown dallas
now there 's this brown haze over it it 's moving north
yeah it 's really sad because they 're not doing anything
we 're getting off the subject i guess
just like with housing they 're not doing anything about pollution
they 're not doing anything about
it 's going to look like
have you ever been to houston
yeah
i used to think that dallas was better than houston because their zoning for where you can put a house next to a
yeah
now it looks just like houston to me
yeah
it does
how long have you been in this house
we 've been in here ten years
ten years
yeah
we 've got some investment in it
you really do n't get anything out of it
no
you really do n't
you said you were out of state for a while was that a smaller town than dallas area
yeah
smaller
we were up in pittsburgh pennsylvania
how was it
my home town
how were the house prices up there
the prices a lot better because pittsburgh is about the size like a louisville or minneapolis that type of size
yeah
the prices what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy-five eighty
wow
yeah
it 's really
we did n't think it was that clean
after you 're gone for a while it looks cleaner
yeah
a lot of these people that i 've talked to that are coming down from what i call the back east especially from j c penney are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy-five thousand dollar houses down here
yeah
they 've wound up getting better houses here than they had there
in a way i guess it works both ways
i guess it 's
yeah
here i guess it depends on what you want
here i got a lot of people that work for j c penney in marketing
yeah
a lot of the people that came from that area probably like what you 're talking about they had a lot of property but not a lot of house
now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it
that 's a fact
they love it
they they think they 're getting
you say sun room to them and you enclose and you can sell it
i guess that 's true
yeah
they do n't have to worry about yard upkeep if they do n't hardly have any
yeah
a lot of them i know a couple women that work there
they do n't miss in public relations
they do n't miss having a basement to run up and down to
that 's true
not too many basements in texas
i said you have n't heard about tornados
how about those
yeah
i remember when i was little we did n't have a
i grew up in southern oklahoma
uh-huh
people across the street had a cellar
we never did
it 's just like dallas area it was tornado alley up there
every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street
we 'd go into the cellar
i to this day i do n't care if i go or not
yep
if it 's going to get me it 's get me
that 's exactly
growing
i grew up in western pennsylvania near pittsburgh
we used to call the basements actual cellars
it 's funny to hear that word because i never hear it
it 's like the back porch used to be a stoop
yeah
the housing is just
we like the older houses
i do n't know if we 're going to stay here or not depends
you ever thought about building a house
pardon me
have you ever thought about building a house
yeah
when we were up north
some family things changed
we ended up come back down here and all that because it helped my husband 's work
we really would like to
we do n't know if we 're going to do it unless we stay here
yeah
that 's true
especially when
with t i it 's like anybody else you never know how long you 're going to be in one place
yeah
it 's real tough
the economy any more
i think everybody just lives under an umbrella the uncertainty with housing and everything
yeah
it 's
do you work
pardon me
do you work
yes
i do
how do you handle
do you have kids
no
we do n't
you got
he 's working and working to get this big house to take care of
how do you manage both of those
how do we take care of the house
i do n't have a mexi-
i should n't say that
i do n't have an ethnic maid
yeah
i do n't have
we have some friends that live near north dallas off of campbell road
they have like a four thousand square foot home
she 's got a live out nanny
any rate i do n't have any of that
i do n't know
it 's really not too difficult with no children and just two people
you basically can take care of everything yourself
we have a
yeah
we have a dog
we 're pretty
we 're not fanatically neat
we keep things up not like where there is three feet of weeds or anything in the yard by the time you need to get around to fertilizing and cutting in the spring
yeah
yeah
what about home repairs and stuff
do you have to do all that yourself
no
we 're pretty much
we 've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wall paper together and things like that
you too
we pretty much hire
we subcontract mostly everything other than anything that 's not a
yeah
i know how to fix a running toilet
yeah
he does what he needs to
mostly if it 's something major cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that we just hire out to do that
sounds like you 've already got the makings for being a general contractor
yeah
no thanks
i
if you do n't wall paper it well together you should probably not build a house together
have you ever done that
yeah
i built three houses in my life
how 'd that go
the building process was a lot of fun
uh-huh
puts a lot of strain on things
getting to agree to things i 'm sure
i also think that once you get to be certain
when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older you start
yeah
the dollar value on things i
you bet
i think people that own homes a lot in north dallas are very materialistic
you bet
i know i 'm supposed to talk about homes
the people that own them are the homes themselves
spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies for custom drapes just does n't
yeah
to some of them i guess it does n't matter that maybe they 've got enough coming in to take care of it
yeah
that 's
you see a lot of these people that came west from new york with exxon or j c penney
it 's just a hoot to watch them
are they
as far as they 're concerned they 've come to the promised land
they 've got it made
right
right
exactly
was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house
yeah
you 're confined by space
i had a
i came out of a thirty-one hundred square foot two story house
my goodness
yeah
i had room for everything
in fact i had more room than knew what to do with
i do n't know
uh-huh
just seems like stuff always expands to fill available space
yeah
in a way you can travel light
you can
you lear- you adjust you figure out
how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that
it 's not as bad as i thought it was
uh-huh
it 's not as bad as i remembered especially going to college and living in apartments there you know how noisy that can be
yes
i do
there seems to be more a mature crowd in apartments at least where i am even though there 's kids all around
there 's traffic
there 's people running up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that
still
everybody pretty much keeps- keeps to their own turf so to speak
yeah
pretty much
there 's never really any
i remember in school
there 's just
seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night
yeah
you do n't run into that up here i think because there 's so many professional people if you want to call them that that go spend all day at work
uh-huh
they want to come home
they want some quiet
relax and try to go to sleep
really
yeah
you see a lot of activity outside people riding bikes playing ball or jogging
they 're doing this and that
they 're trying to unwind
i think plano in general is getting a little more
it 's gotten so big it 's almost a town in it 's own right
yeah
it 's a hundred and what eighty thousand something like that
something
yeah
the price of home
we paid about seventy-eight nine for our house like i said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago
i 'd say they appraised it
gone up maybe like five percent
yeah
it 's an investment
it 's something that
when you 're first married or starting out you think if you really have something
you really
it 's just real
nowadays with the way the income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize
you bet
the thing that gets me is you never really catch up you never really finish doing things you 're always paying for something
yeah
exactly
we
yeah
even
we had i called them prefabs just a tract home
we had one of their homes that was nicer in pennsylvania
it was an older home
you buy an older home and you 're always fixing things up
you are constantly
there 's always something going wrong
okay
great
currently i 'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program
huh-uh
i 'm mainly do a lot of walking
i have a son that 's a little bit overweight
the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around
my wife and i kind of take turns
at one time i had a fairly regular exercise program
in the last couple of months i 've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down
all this space that normally would be dedicated towards the exercise area is covered in boxes
yeah
what did you do when you did exercise regularly
i had a little routine that i did for warm ups
huh-uh
i did some very mild light weight lifting
nothing
i 'm not trying to make big bulging muscles just trying to try and stay as firm as i can stay in my old age
huh-uh
yeah
right now i try when it 's nice out
it 's been raining a lot this spring
i try to
i have a bicycle
i like to cycle a lot
my husband and i we have entered a few rallies that 's pretty popular in texas
i do n't know if it 's up north
huh-uh
every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally
thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles which that 's a lot of fun
huh-uh
we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that
t i where i work has a fitness center
a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends we 'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill
they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine that are fun to ride and workout on
i try to
i 'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis
i used to get into it and get out of it based on my schedule
i 'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now
it 's a big commitment
we do n't have any kids yet
that 's a part of it
yeah
that 's a plus
i have a total of five children
i have three left living at home
huh-uh
they do take up a big part of my evening and weekend
yeah
it 's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself too
yeah
it 's something they do n't tell you about when you 're growing up
when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children
huh-uh
that 's why at t i they really stress staying in shape stay in overall fitness no smoking and all that
it 's hard to find an actual exercise regimen that work for you because i know a lot of people that cycle they take their kids behind them on the bikes
i do n't know if that would work for me because i do n't know i would n't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain
it 's really hard to find something that works and to find time to do it and stay committed to it three days a week or whatever
i think maybe walking or running would probably work because it does n't take much time and much money or whatever
yeah
yeah
you have to
what i found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself
huh-uh
you can use what ever rationale you want
basically the healthier you stay the longer you 'll live
right
if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer then i 'll around a lot longer
those people that i 'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now get the enjoyment of me years past where i would have been if i would n't have taken it
huh-uh
if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine
yeah
i 've been learning a lot lately about
i 've been reading a book by kenneth cooper
i do n't know if you 're familiar with him
huh-uh
he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health
he 's kind of he 's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing
he was talking about the three things that cause aging smoking are inactivity * [ [ mistranscribed listen
what was the other one i think was obesity
if you can control those three areas then are you going to live longer cause those are risk factors it 's kind of a tip
yeah
i 've done a lot of study over the years
i found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water
really
yeah
the research that i 've done
i 've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three
huh-uh
it 's amazing that prior to nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks
huh-uh
there were none prior to nineteen-hundred
in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities
after that we started having the hearts attacks
dr price wrote a book coronary cholesterol and chlorine
you can usually find it in a health food store
huh-uh
i know they had it in health food stores in plano
i used live in plano
dr price
dr price
yeah
it 's amazing
he makes the
it 's a very small book
the guys very opinionated
he makes a very good case against chlorine
there were no heart attacks before we started using it
he points out that people in england
even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we 're ingesting now
they were n't dropping dead of heart attacks
yeah
he did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours and proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis which is the clogging of the arteries
huh-uh
yeah
he 's
there 's been a lot of reports since then
this whole thing about
first it was stress then it went to cholesterol
now they 're saying what 's cholesterol
there 's good cholesterol and there 's bad cholesterol
huh-uh
it 's amazing what he points out in that book
in fact everyone there was a toxicologist for the environmental protection agency who did work back in nineteen eighty-six who wrote a letter to dr price in nineteen eighty-seven in this letter he praised dr price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that e p a had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis
e p a never published that report
what 's the name of this book again
coronary cholesterol and chlorine
i 'll have to remember that
yeah
that will be very interesting
my husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon
he 's really interested in the heart
yeah
in fact he 's a heart too
he 's done a lot of research on how your heart reacts to exercise
sorry
he made me laugh
yeah
there is a lot of good information out there about health
a lot of the myths they 've been passing around people are starting to realize are n't true
yeah
i 'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that because that 's good for you
huh-uh
to believe some of the things
i do n't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet
to think that solely alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is just hard to believe
if you get a chance read dr cooper 's book on controlling cholesterol
huh-uh
that 's a real good
he talks about that
talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that
yeah
i actually eat pretty much anything that i want
huh-uh
i 've had my cholesterol checked a few times
i 've never been above one-hundred and fifty never
huh-uh
i
you have a good ratio of good to bad cholesterol
everything is within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing
they leave themselves wide open so they ca n't be sued
yeah
we 've
i work at the t i site in hunt valley maryland
really
yeah
we 've had a few of the health fairs up here
i 've always come out aces
that 's good
i 'm not really that big on watching what i eat
i do eat some health cookies that are high in fiber low in fat and all that kind of stuff
yeah
i mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine i 'm not worried about it
i personally do n't have any problem with drug testing employees or potential employees do you
basically
basically no
okay
i do n't
i really ca n't disagree with it
i
the policy that t i has i think is very fair
uh-huh
i
they first had a policy where they would test new employees
since i 've been with them the last four years there 's been in the last year year and a half they 're doing random testing of all employees
uh-huh
i think that 's really the only fair way to do it
yes
i really think it ought to be s-
junkins all the way down
it is
it
from what i understand it is jerry junkins all the way down
right
as a matter of fact i want to think they took the top managers first
is n't that a fact
i 've been retired from t i about a year
uh-huh
the program was still fairly new
i guess it had been going on maybe almost a year before i retired
uh-huh
i was not ever called upon to do a drug test
i certainly would n't object to it
i think random is probably the only really fair way to do it
yeah
i like it because
i i grew up in the sixties i saw
uh-huh
uh-huh
i know my friends who were druggies and friends who were n't i think it 's a real problem
uh-huh
uh-huh
i
absolutely
i think it 's causing us a lot of trouble and a lot of problems
yeah
uh-huh
i 'm hoping that a lot of other companies will follow the same path
i do n't think they 'll have much choice do you
probably not
especially if they have anything do with government contracts or anything
as matter of fact i want to believe that the defense department more or less mandated that people who work on defense contracts do some sort of drug testing
uh-huh
i think that 's really what maybe prompted t i to do it
i was in the defense electronic division when i retired
i know it was a real hot hot item there
i want to think maybe they really got some nudging from d o d to do this sort of thing
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
you know the atmosphere then
yep
yeah
very aware of it like school systems and that kind of thing
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
i agree
i
i 'd like to know that my child 's being taught by a teacher who 's not on drugs or who might be at a point where they 're trying to sell my kid drugs
that 's right
that 's r-
absolutely
yeah
i d-
i just ca n't disagree the basic premise
yeah
it 's to m-
as far as i know it 's seems to be a fairly accurate program as far as the testing goes
i like the idea that they have a system where they allow you to be retested if for some reason there may have been a problem or something did show up
that 's right
that 's right
offer you help if you need help
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
rather than just put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself
yeah
that 's right
that 's not going to help anybody get over the problem
no
ab-
i believe it is a a medical problem
that 's right
of course i also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world too
absolutely
not to mention alcohol
yeah
there 's a lot of things out there
yep
yep
i 'm just glad that they decided not to tax drugs otherwise they 'd be legal
uh-huh
they 'd be getting tax money off it the same way they are the alcohol and tobacco
that 's right
that 's right
gosh
it 's a real problem
i 'm sure
i 'm sure
yeah
i have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy and stuff
uh-huh
i moved to a t i facility that had never had random drug sampling before because they were outside of the military sector
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
it was an industrial company that t i purchased
the people here a lot of them are real opposed to it
yeah
uh-huh
they were really opposed to it
uh-huh
there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs
uh-huh
that 's why they were opposed to it
right
it resulted in a few people leaving because they just flat out were n't going to put up with the policy
uh-huh
uh-huh
they had a life-style
they were n't going to change it
yeah
right
it 's
yeah
i know a lot of people who when it first be-
at least began was in the talking sta-
everybody knew it was coming
it just a matter of time everybody was screaming invasion of privacy and all this stuff
a lot of people i think after they thought about it for awhile weighed the pros and cons decided it 's really not a bad idea unless you 're doing drugs of course
yeah
you should have no objection to it
it 's like going down to get your license and checking your eyes
that 's right
why do i need my eyes checked
uh-huh
that 's right
yep
yep
you know it 's why are we doing this
so you do n't kill people on the road
that 's right
or yourself
it 's a ba-
it 's the basic premise with drug testing
yeah
that 's right
especially some of the jobs
luckily i 've always been in the engineering sector
uh-huh
it 's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as hurting someone
uh-huh
it 's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it
yeah
that 's true
in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor and down in some of those labs and stuff if i 'd want somebody down there that i 'm working with side by side that could kill me by doing something incorrectly because they were not exactly all there because they were on drugs
uh-huh
yeah
assembly people
that 's right
that 's r-
absolutely
there 's a lot of sectors where i think that would would help out
i think in the long run we all benefit
uh-huh
absolutely
yeah
if you have
if you 're not working with someone on drugs then you 're going to have less accidents
uh-huh
you have less accidents
you spend less money on medical
uh-huh
you spend less money on medical then the company 's more profitable
yeah
the company 's more profitable then maybe they can pay you more
sure
if they can pay you more you can buy more
uh-huh
it
it goes around to everywhere
sure
trickles up and down
yep
all over
sure does
yeah
affects a lot of people
it certainly does
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
and and start it up
i think they probably will
if they
i 'm sure it 's a very expensive program to administer
i 'm not sure every small company could do it
a lot of companies are coming down in price
uh-huh
i think that the insurance companies are starting to give benefits
uh-huh
reduction in medical costs if they
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
it 's got to help them too
yeah
i think everybody will benefit from the program
uh-huh
yeah
i do too
that 's right
i think if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say if you impose mandatory drug testing we 'll reduce your insurance costs by twenty per cent
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
of course the company 's not going to reduce the employee 's cost of insurance twenty per cent they 're going to reduce their own
no
no
it 'll save in some areas
yeah
right
yeah
that 'll cover it
maybe some insurance companies might start offering it as part of the package
that 's right
that certainly could happen
that 's a very very very competitive business
yeah
it
i think i think all around it 's going to help out a lot
yeah
i do too
course
i just really ca n't disagree with you
yeah
okay
it 's nice to talk to you
it was great talking with you
you take care
you do the same
okay
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
we can be recorded while we talk about it
okay
is your
does your city have mandatory recycling
no
we do n't have mandatory
we 're kind of slow up here
we 've just started doing recycling probably last summer
it 's all voluntary
that 's interesting
cities have a mandatory recycling
there 're some places that are strongly encouraging it
that they city will pick it up
that 's been one of the arguments here
i 'm just sitting here looking we 've got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff
we have to carry it some distance
some places you can sell your recyclables
for example our church was collecting newspapers
yeah
when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing
we got like a penny a pound for them
it turns out that so much
the problem in texas is that they 've got so much paper now from people recycling that they 've got no way to reprocess it
my
it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it
the value has gone down
it turns out it was n't worth for the church to do
i did n't realize
you would think
now up here i suppose they send it all back to the mill
there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of
there is one in northern vermont
there 's probably a paper mill that 's sixty miles from here
i did n't think that
in the large city that if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away it 's a lot of money to transport
yeah
that 's
in dallas there no plan to build
i think there 's some in east texas there 's some pulp mills
you have to go to houston
it 's interesting
there 's places that will buy metal
they still buy aluminum can and likes that * [ [ can > cans likes > like
do you have to buy metal
copper is a very good one to collect
even aluminum
yeah
do you do recycling
we do the recycling
our city will pick up our recyclables
oh
they have these little blue bins
i do n't recycle personally
i 'm saying i want to do it
i do n't get a lot of magazines
i do n't get a
i do n't buy the newspaper
i do have a lot of
my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of different papers and cardboards
do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans
yes
we have a bottle return
a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles
we 've had five cent deposits on our bottles for years
it 's worth taking them back
we do n't have
we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles
they should definitely get the nickel returnable
it 's great for the kids because
a lot of the kids get the money from it
it 's great for the boy scouts running around they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes
that 's it
you 'll
there is a down side to all this about no good deed going unpunished that my mother sells trees that they make paper out of
every time i recycle newspapers in fact there 's a
kimberly and clark the makers of kleenex and such has a big paper mill
yeah
in fact i almost went to work for them
i was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me
it 's twenty or thirty miles from my house
every time you recycle that 's one less tree my mother can sell
it 's a question should i be diligent and and recycle and put my mother out of her livelihood
and recycle
yes
i see that
it 's an interesting point though that everybody 's so anxious to recycle
i suppose it does provide some gainful employment
it takes away employment from the resource
its
in general i think it 's a good idea because like the glass you ca n't argue that the glass
i do too
it does n't biodegrade and the plastics obviously
they do n't either
we might as well recycle those
yeah
like i say it 's not a very controversial thing
everyone thinks we should do it
it 's just that we 're so lazy
personally i do n't want to clean my
i just have can cat food
i do n't want to clean the can and take the label off it and put it in a separate bin
yeah
i 'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash
that 's what we 've got
we started about new year 's we decided we 'd get ambitious
we took one load over there
now we 've got these containers filling up with stuff
it 's not a very high priority thing to go haul these containers over there
yeah
i think i would be like
when i bring my bottles back if they 're pretty clean and stuff so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months
i get a whole bunch of them and bring them over
if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean like if i washed all the cans and things i would n't mind if it sat around too much
if it stunk or something i would n't like doing it
i produce quite a bit of trash
my house
i see it
i do n't see so much that i can recycle
yeah
like i say it 's a lot of different type paper and cardboard
i 'm not a real plastic person user but a lot of paper pretty much
i do n't know how they sort that
if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles i would think that i would have a recycling center
now it 's just me and my husband
i do n't know
every little bit helps
right
yeah
i know what you 're saying
we have a very aggressive recycling at work
i 'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin
some people the recycle bin is on their way out
instead of carrying your newspapers when they get done with them at the end of the day they throw them in the trash
do you have separate trash cans at your desk
no
we do n't
other offices do
they have a box for papers
we have one that 's recyclable and then for lunch sacks and waste food
they gave us a list of things that are n't re-
it turns out it 's not so bad
i get a lot of reports that are covered in plastic or like saran wrap or something { d anyway
} cardboard there 's a few
it 's interesting that we 're recycling computer type paper
yeah
one day they 'll pick up
the cleaning people come through and they 'll pick up recycled paper
the next day they 'll pick up the other
oh
depending on how much
there 's a lot of it works pretty well
we have a waste cans for aluminum in the break areas at work
that 's a really good idea because our fruit juices for some reason when they 're in a can do n't come with a deposit
yeah
they 're thinking about putting a deposit on them because you 're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans where they 're so much easier just to put a deposit on it because probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because they 're beer and soda
yeah
when they sell juice it 's some strange quirk in the law you do n't have to have a deposit on it
even like a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it
if it 's got soda in it it does
it 's a strange
that 's an interesting distinction
yeah
they should clear that up
it would n't take them much to put a stamp on the juice cans as easily as the soda
yeah
redemption centers are a big thing up here
they get a penny a can they handle
they give you five cents when they return the can to the distributor
i think they get a penny two pennies a can
those of us that do n't have state income taxes
yet that 's the big debate here in texas that the legislature wants to put one in
yeah
it 's interesting what people get upset about
it really is
is bottle return down there a heated debate
no
yeah
we
here you ca n't drink
we 're not civilized now you can not drink beer and drive it was actually legal
yes
i know i was in atlanta
you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand
here let me put that in a paper cup for you
that was strange
i think
if some people they have
they say we 're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all the recycle center you have to deal with the can and then you have to recycle it
their problem 's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits see how they handle it
yeah the other thing is it also is a is a good habit to just to conserve resources because you get in the habit of that you think in terms of of of things like saving
see if it 's a good way
do it that way because like i say people are making money on it
the cans are worth something
are we tonight
yeah
sure
okay
let me go ahead and press one
okay leslie
i 'd like to find out a little bit about your hobbies
what do you like to do in your spare time
when i have my spare time i do enjoy
it 's a cherished commodity now days
that 's right
i do enjoy sewing
i hand
i do some needlepoint
great
i 've been doing a a picture for my father-in-law
if i ever get enough spare time he might see it one day
uh-huh
some other things i like to do are music and also reading
what kind of music
i enjoy singing
okay
yeah
great
i enjoy music too
i
one thing that i like to do is sit down and play the piano
i ca n't play that well
i enjoy that
uh-huh
a couple of hobbies that i also have is
i really enjoy bike riding
the biggest hobbies i have right now are my kids and whatever they are involved in
yes
like my oldest boy is involved in soccer
we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football
we also like to ride bicycles
we 're riding bicycles
a lot of the hobbies that i have right now are centered around my children and also things that my wife and i like to do together
uh-huh
personally a lot of the hobbies i had when i was growing up and going to college and so forth are having to change
uh-huh
i really enjoyed mountain climbing
i really enjoyed skiing and a lot of outdoor activities
there 's not a whole lot of mountains here in texas that i can go skiing with that right now
that 's right
hopefully i will be able to get back to the slopes some day
yeah
i have not had the opportunity to go skiing
i grew up in arizona which has some mountains around it never did get out and ski
uh-huh
you did n't
no
i never did
i guess i did n't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing
of course i was at that stage of my life where i had to be taken to places
i could n't go by myself
yeah
that 's true
that 's true
of course once i got to the age where i could have done it myself i had other interests i guess
yeah
i guess that for me it was very helpful
my two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing
yeah
we went quite often
in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing
when i lived around in that area my brother would fly in from chicago
we would go skiing and enjoy that
uh-huh
luckily it 's kind of unusual because hobbies it 's a nice thing to have
it 's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to like you mentioned
i am finding out a lot of the spare time that i had is n't there
that 's right
it 's taken up by activities with work with family with civic and church responsibilities for me
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i find if i make i have to make myself realize that it is important to get out there and just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
my youngest daughter is going to be starting up soccer
she 's real excited about doing that
great
we will be busy with that again
what again
you have participated with that in the past
pardon me
have you participated in that in the past
i did with my older daughter
uh-huh
she was in it for a few years
she has got so many interests herself that we had to start eliminating
the first one to go
she still likes her piano
uh-huh
she is in band
she 's got lots of hobbies or activities going on
it sounds like her life is full too
yeah
i imagine your life is full taking them around all over the place
very much
that 's right
that 's right
all right
all right
leslie it 's been very nice talking to you
is there anything else that you would like to mention tonight
no
i think we covered it pretty good
okay
great
thank you for calling
thank you
you have a nice evening
you too
bye
bye
bye now
what kind of neat hobbies do you have
i like gardening a lot
i like to be outside
i like gardening
i wish i had a green thumb though
i 've got a brown thumb
that 's what everything turns
is
do you keep trying anyway
i keep trying
you just ca n't give up on it
i bought some plants from michigan bulb company
they send them to you all ready alive
no
no
i 've never had any luck with their 's
really
right
i guess these are going to croak too
since i 've got cats i decided to get some catnip
oh
lots and lots of catnip
it 's still green
it 's been two days
i 'm encouraged
no
i have n't had good luck with that company
i think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail probably
yeah
i 've had to get my money back from them and had better luck with some of the more expensive companies
yeah
there 's a
because they
i do n't know
do you have lowe 's up there
its
building contra-
building supplies place
no
they also have a garden shop
uh-huh
that 's great
yeah
our local stores do n't offer any guarantee
some of the
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
something like that
i got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff
i 'm going to wait on those
they 're bulbs for spring or fall
probably spring
i do n't much care about things like that
i 'll make a little sort of greenhouse a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in
something to keep me occupied
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'll buy some plastic and make a little house
cute
yeah
watch the cats tear it up
right
i do n't know that
do cats bother bulbs
i think more the mice or other rodents
they just like to get in and dig
i see
if you have fresh dirt they 'll
they love to dig
i had some
i do n't know what kind they are
i 've already forgotten
just regular old flower seeds
i planted them
i was so thrilled because they came up nice green shoots coming up all over the place
my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that
gee
i have to hang these things high
they ca n't get to them
especially the catnip
how many cats do you have
three
okay
i just put a little fence around my yard which is i suppose technically illegal
i had so many groundhogs last year that i think they 'll let me get by with it
it 's got this one inch mesh
what i 've noticed it 's kept the cats out
i love it
yeah
yeah
because they like to get in and fertilize things too
why would it be illegal
because we have these tow-
i live in a townhouse
all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission
yeah
right
they want privacy fences
if nobody complains you 're all right
right
right
they do walking tours too
at least because i back up to a hillside where the wild animals are i think i can probably justify it
yeah
an
if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway
right
right
i me-
you do n't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property
right
the first year the deer ate my garden
i was just astounded
i 'm going deer right here in the city
yeah
right here bambi
exactly
gosh
let 's see
other than gardening which i fiddle at
i 'm not very good at
what else do i mostly just computer stuff
oh
i just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that
cooking that 's not really a hobby
it 's a necessity
i enjoy it
i like to think that i 'm a very good cook
great
hobbies
that 's about it
i do n't have much time for hobbies between being a student and trying to run a business on the side
you do n't have a lot of time
right
that keeps you busy
yeah
raising cats
that could become a hobby
it started out as a hobby
uh-huh
it developed into sort of a business
we breed them and all that
we did n't really start it for the money
it was just
they were fun to have around
we figured if we 're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds
now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them and all this kind of stuff
uh-huh
what kind of cats are they
i 've got a bombay a turkish van and a himalayan persian
wow
yeah
the is probably the sweetest one
she 's just a little sweetheart
we
the bombay had a litter last october
w-
i just got her back from the vet this morning getting her spayed
only going to breed them once
okay
she 's not feeling too great today
is that typical to only breed them once
no
most breeders are in it for the money
they 'll breed them twice a year i just think that i do n't know it 's kind of cruel
uh-huh
uh-huh
they just breed these they breed them before they 're ready you 're never rea-
right
they do a lot of inbreeding too
you end up with kind of strange kittens
uh-huh
uh-huh
i just do n't like that
will you breed one of the litter then next year
we sold all that litter
oh
we
there 's not that much call for bombays
uh-huh
they 're registered
they 're not they 're not show cats
i see
all you can do is sell them as pet quality
uh-huh
what you 've got is a registered pet
not too many people want bombays
they want things like himie persians and turkish vans
uh-huh
turkish vans if you 've never seen one you would n't know that it was a pure bred
it 's just medium size short hair cat
it 's got
he 's mostly white with brown and black patches
oh
they have nice personalities
they 're very inquisitive
the himie we 'll probably breed her a couple of times
we 'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those
right
it 's just the stud fees are so much though
it 'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her
we want to breed her with a champion
right
now these are long haired
yeah
the persian is
uh-huh
uh-huh
the other two are short hairs
right
that 's nice
yeah
she 's sweet
going to have some nice kittens i hope
uh-huh
she 's
if you know what a himalayan is generally they look something like
they come in a lot of different colors
people do n't realize it
they 're sort of siamese in a way
they have the gloves on the paws
they 're usually two colored
this one is
she 's predominantly black
she has chocolate paws chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters
gee
yeah
she 's quite attractive looking
uh-huh
uh-huh
hope the stud will find her attractive
that she has kittens that look like her
that she has a whole bunch of kittens
we have to be careful
we have to get a particular color point stud
you ca n't just breed them with anything
we have to get a silver point himie
that the silver will be predominate in the kittens
i see
that 's the fun part trying to figure out what you 've got to breed them with
ca n't just go out there and say you guys breed
you ca n't just tell them that anyway
that 's right
it really sounds like a business more than a hobby
it is a business in a way
it 's a lot of fun as a hobby especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats
we 're about to get another breed
we 're going to buy a
i do n't like at first
what is it
it 's a mutant
it comes from england and in the county of devon
oh
it 's a mutant cat
they 're pretty expensive
we 're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one
they 're very thin
they 're they 're long and lanky and skinny
they have real short hair
it 's curly as a matter of fact
interesting
yeah
it it 's a strange looking cat
i did n't like them at first
they 've got great big ears
are you in the market for a new car
yeah
i am as a matter of fact
i 'm looking for another car
new
probably not
oh
what sort of requirements to you have for your car
sports car
uh-huh
usually black red
uh-huh
and electric windows and power locks
i see
top of the line
not so much that as it is
i 've had so many times when i 'll have a friend next to me or i see guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window
oh
it is just a real pain
if i 'm driving along and there 's somebody next to me and somebody that i know and you try to talk to them it 's real difficult to drive reach over and try to roll down the window
uh-huh
right
right
power locks power windows are just things that just really help a lot
uh-huh
uh-huh
what about you
i guess i 'm more traditional in that i do n't like power windows or power locks because the people that i know who have them always seem to have trouble with them
oh
i just do n't like anything that i ca n't figure out why it does n't work
sure
i want good gas mileage
i want an air bag
i guess
have you ever had a car with an air bag
no
i have n't
have you
no
somehow i just think i like the idea
it sure seems to save lives
right
yeah
i like the anti-lock brakes
right
that 's a good idea
i have never had a chance to
i have been in cars that have had them
i 've never tromped on the brakes on ice or water just to see if they did n't lock up
uh-huh
uh-huh
you think you 'd buy an american car or a european or japanese
i do n't know a lot about different brands
i tend to have my requirements like the last time i bought a car i guess i did sort of prefer american
my requirements were basically good repair record good mileage
i needed air-conditioning
ca n't remember what my
i wanted stick shift i did n't have a whole lot of choice
there was one car in all of the metropolitan area that i could find that was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it
what was that
it turned out to be a chrysler lancer
huh
stick shift
huh
yeah
did it have what a three speed or a four speed
no
a five speed
basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and had n't picked up
it had been on the lot three months
they were really eager to sell it
wow
i guess in this area at least if it 's not automatic it does n't move
i much prefer a stick shift
what i 'm curious
i know why i love a stick shift
why did you want one
i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one
i thought it would be more reliable
uh-huh
it 's hard to find stick shift cars anymore
i found that out
the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when i went in to and asked and that was a requirement
huh
yeah
no
most of the sports cars are stick shift
i 'm not even sure all of them are anymore at least in this area
huh
not that i was looking for sports cars
the people i 've talked to do n't seem to have stick shift
huh
why do you like stick shift
i guess i grew up on it it 's fun
it 's an enjoyable part of driving
i do feel like i have more control over the car
uh-huh
it to me it gives me more a lot more control in snow and ice and slick conditions
uh-huh
right
it does
i do n't know
it 's really more fun than anything
as long as you 're not stuck in heavy traffic it 's fun
right
it 's probably safer on long trips because it keeps you more active
yeah
yeah
yeah
of course i like gadgets and fun things on the cars which are all the things course the c-
all right ( ( carolyn
when do ) ) you
are you reading the papers about the middle east summit
some
yes
i 'm just a little bit too
i think i was worn out from middle east after the war
yeah
i think it did n't really take over the first page quite as much as it did i think during the war
uh-huh
we definitely need something there with all the hostages and what all
yeah
yeah
wha-
that 's i think
i do n't know in the short run it would be really nice to get the hostages all back
uh-huh
i think that 's really really important
yeah
i think they just have a whole different world than we do
i do n't know
i do n't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be
i just see this middle east situation with russia and everything there that 's happened i think that that crisis has kind of slowed down
i see the middle east as being the real hot spot of the future so to speak
uh-huh
yeah
i guess i view it as being the prime importance as far as trying to wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there
uh-huh
yeah
i think
i do n't know i just have this civil rights mentality i guess
you know should we
should we
i wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do
uh-huh
i guess that 's what i hope for them
some of them do n't want those freedoms i think
their religious beliefs may not
they may not want it as a whole
i think that 's something that has to be considered too
yeah
i think that 's really a long term type thing
i know that the
it said think about long term repercussions
i was just thinking peace is peace
uh-huh
that really is the nicest thing
i guess the question in my mind somewhat
it depends on the country
i think some are more peaceful than others
uh-huh
yeah
if you look at iraq for example and the recent thing with the u n going in there and the bomb development and all this kind of stuff
yeah
uh-huh
gosh
i think we should have got him while we could or whatever
yeah
yeah
i think so
i think
i think there 's a certain mentality to that 's in the middle east the constant fighting
right
i think they realized we would probably never push him out
i think the other
probably all of the other arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out
yeah
i think they look at force as a way of their means to their ends
uh-huh
yeah
yep
i do n't know so much if these peace talks are going to
i do n't know how much they 'll stay to them
uh-huh
if we even if we say that we 're going to do stuff i do n't know how they 'll stick to that
yeah
i think the thing is though i guess the arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any ideas that coincide with the u s ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the soviet union
uh-huh
i guess that 's all gone
i think that 's really probably what started the whole process
uh-huh
i
that 's probably a bonus on our part
yeah
yes
it is
i think that they 're so much more vulnerable now because they do n't receive support from the soviet union
uh-huh
i guess they 're saying we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries two ways
we can act like we 're going to be pro-communist act like we 're going to be pro-democracy
whatever gets us the most that 's what we 'll act like we 're going to do
we really wo n't change in the long run
yeah
i think that 's the way i sort of see them all working
i tend to agree with you
yeah
i think they have in mind what they want to do
i think a lot of times their
uh-huh
it
kind of the forceful
i do n't know
i just do n't think peace is uppermost in their minds
yeah
it 's really funny as an american and always being an ally with the israelis
i always find it very hard in my heart to align with the israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the arabs
uh-huh
then again they have to live in that environment
they have to be subjected to all of the arab bombings and terrorist attacks and whatever
yeah
then they have to negotiate almost everything
then you think to yourself in your heart you do n't want to be aligned with somebody that 's mean and cruel to someone else
if that 's the environment that they have to live in and survive in then you have to sort of
i do n't know
logically
hi clarice
have you had a family reunion recently
yes
just this last summer we went back to utah
we met it was my
we usually go to my family reunion
this one was my husband 's
uh-huh
they 're usually quite similar i think
are you both from utah originally
no
he 's from here
uh-huh
most of his people are from oregon
we kind of met halfway
uh-huh
this was one
they planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and had
how nice
things like that have to be planned
they had planned
we went to the reunion in end of june and first of july that part the fourth of july weekend
uh-huh
uh-huh
we had to plan everything clear in december january to reserve that
sure
sure
was this his entire family cousins aunts uncles like that or his immediate family
uh-huh
no
wow
this was everybody
wow
how many people were there
i jeez i think over three hundred were there
wow
it was quite a large
wow
it was a great big lodge
we had plenty of room and everything
some of them live in that area
it was n't too hard for them to come in the day and leave
uh-huh
that was a great big thing
we do that with his family about every five years a great big one
immediate family we try to do one thing once a year
how many people are in his immediate family
he has eight brothers and sisters
wow
that 's big by itself
wow
it really is
you get together once a year
yeah
wow
we have a little shindig with them they 're in a close proximity
are they all here in the area
are they scattered
let 's see
there are four of them who live here in texas and his mom and dad
uh-huh
the others live in close neighboring states like nevada arizona i think like that
uh-huh
yeah
wow
that 's wonderful
it 's been fun
how about you
we do n't really get together
i would love to
that 's why i checked that i wanted to do that because i would love to plan a family reunion sometime
i have a sister in colorado and a sister in upstate new york and a sister in connecticut and here i am in texas
we 're kind of scattered right now
uh-huh
my cousins they put on a family reunion once a year
it 's always like the second week in september
it 's
the kids are already back in school
uh-huh
that 's back in the
that 's hard
that 's in new york
there 's just no possible way
yeah
yeah
it 's not really a weekend
it 's just like a day kind of thing because most of them are
my family moved to connecticut
the rest of the family stayed in new york and on long island
uh-huh
they 're all kind of local and close
they just have a day picnic
i 've always thought it would be so neat even if it were just my immediate family to have like a weekend type thing
yeah
that would be so wonderful
it really is fun
my mom 's family does it once a year just like you said
uh-huh
once a year they have a a wednesday through a saturday type thing
you can come and go as you please type thing
wow
they do that once a year
i kind of missed it this year and felt bad
you ca n't go every year
you just can not do that
yeah
yeah
yeah
do they have a hotel
where do you stay
basically they just stay with each other brothers or sisters
there are enough in the area to just kind of span yourself out
take everybody
yeah
whoever 's mom and dad it is you usually go and stay with them
i go stay with my mother
my cousins they just go stay with their mom and dad kind of thing
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's not hard in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one utah area
yeah
yeah
that 's not hard the real planning that 's the real key
that sounds so wonderful
is n't that nice
yeah
they send out
my mom 's family now
this is the first reunion with my husband 's family i 've really been involved with
my mom 's family each brother and sister takes a turn one year
that 's how they divide it up
uh-huh
then one brother and sister from each family
uh-huh
each one of them take their turn
wow
uh-huh
the parent who 's turn it is her children help her
uh-huh
if it was my mother 's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing
i see uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
wow
yeah
the thing is that the real part is there are two mailings that go out
the first one is to just kind of give an approximate date and time so you can start making
have you got a pet
y-
no
i do n't
an
my kids would love a pet
i had a pet when i was a girl
i had a cocker spaniel
i think one thing about pets is they 're a lot of company
yeah
you can tell them anything
they wo n't tell anybody
that 's right
that 's unconditional affection
right
as a matter of fact i was thinking that same thing unconditional love
they just give it and do n't expect too much
yeah
do you have a pet
i had a cat
i 've had several cats
my pet was hit by a car new year 's eve
oh
i 'm going to get another one as soon as i get back in town
i 'm going out of town this weekend
when i get back i 'm going to find a cat
i 'm so sorry
that 's good that you 're going to get another one
yeah
i know some of my friends who have pets
they just are really
the ones that have dogs are very protective of them
i think that 's one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets
they just really take care of them or are protective of them
ye-
i work and go to school
it 's kind of nice
tha-
you come home your pet 's there for you and wants a little food a little attention
yeah
an
my kids
that 's
it 's kind of fun
they really want a dog badly
they 've been looking and looking
want
they 'd take anything i think
yeah
i do n't know do you like
i guess your cat was an indoor cat
no
it was kind of indoor outdoor it was
it kind of traveled around
yeah
i do n't care for the smell of the litter box
my cat was trained to go outside
other than that it was inside when it wanted to be it was outside when
yeah
when i had a cocker spaniel it was an outdoor dog
i think i liked that better
yeah
i think
i like dogs
i think that
i 'm
kind of like big dogs
you have to have room for them
yeah
that 's true
dogs take a lot more care than cats do
cats are pretty independent
you feed them
they keep themselves clean if you raise them right you do n't have to worry about the litter box thing where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and things like that
yeah
that 's true
take them for walks
right
yeah
i see all the people on sunday going for a walk with their dogs
i 'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog
i 'm like i know it will be fun the first week maybe
yeah
mom gets to take care of it or something
i gue-
yeah
i got to take care of a friend of mine 's dog
he 's just got a puppy
he was out of town last weekend
of course the dog is not trained for anything yet
it was go over there and clean up after the dog
that 's exciting
yeah
kids kind of
they want the fun part and not the work
yeah
i think it 's really important to that if you get a pet that they 're spayed neutered so that we 're not just going on with this pet population and having to just get rid of them
yeah
that kind of gripes on me some
i do n't know
if you 're going to have a pet and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to deal with the consequences take care of the offspring
more and more people are
right
right
i think
when i was growing up we had cats
just seeing the miracle of birth that 's a neat thing to experience as a kid and understand
i think that 's really true
it was a real positive thing
on the other hand you do n't want to be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road
yeah
they 're they 're getting old now
it 's time to get rid of them
yeah
exactly
exactly
i think our community is a lot more conscious now though too
that 's good too
yeah
i think that 's all i have to say
okay
okay
have a good night
all right
bye-bye
bye
i basically listen to the news from the t v
that 's probably the only time i get a chance to take a look at it is the evening news
if i 'm lucky i might be able to hear something through news wise
other than that that 's probably how i get my source unless something really tragic happens and somebody tells me it about through conversation or whatever
most of the time it is through the news in the evening
that 's about the
you do n't get any newspapers
newspapers
no
i 'm not too much in reading newspapers
not that i do n't enjoy newspapers or anything like that
part of it is because i just do n't feel like i need to have them with watching the t v or whatever
we get our weekly news around the area
i might look through it real quick if there 's something that catches my interest in regards to what 's going on around the county or little bit of the state
the majority of the time now i do n't get a daily newspaper where i get tons of news coming in that kind of stuff
i 'm kind of the opposite of you
i get all my news from newspapers
you do
we have two newspapers
you read it in the morning then
yeah
two newspapers in the morning i 'm in a government position that i 'm in the news a lot
uh-huh
sure
i kind of look through to see what i 'm quoted in
sure
how bad the quotes are every day
to see if they did it or if they criticize you or put something in there wrong
yeah
sure
sure
sometimes there 's letter to the editor about me
there 's a even editorials for against what i 'm doing
uh-huh
sure
sure
exactly
the t v i do n't really watch even if i 'm on it
uh-huh
sure
just
that 's kind of like you said then
we are kind of on the opposite where i get home and while i 'm cooking supper the t v is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on
very seldom do i catch the ten o'clock
by that time old news is probably what i hear through the grapevine or whatever
unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then i think everybody was glued to the t v to find out what was going on
right
other than that no
it 's
that 's
c n n had the { f uh
} everybody was watching c n n
that seemed to be the place to be to find out what was going on on that
exactly
exactly
exactly
sure
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
it brought kind of more of a vivid look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things
yeah
that 's true
a lot of people that read the newspapers to get the news of what 's going on
other people that do it differently or do n't even watch any news at all
the thing is with t v i
a lot of times the news on the local t v is so brief you really do n't get the full picture of what 's going on
exactly happens
sure
sure
that 's
that 's a problem that i have is not getting just a little brief idea of what 's happening
sure
a clip a sentence or two
that 's about it of what went on
they have so much other information to cover in such a short period of time
sure
right i like the weather report
makes sense
yeah
i wa-
always i always turn that on
yeah
yeah
that 's one part i watch because i go surfing down here
i always want to watch the weather for when the waves are going to be good
uh-huh
you 're right on the coast line
you 're not further up
you 're
yeah
no
uh-huh
sure
sure
i suppose you watch for hurricanes coming in and things like that
yeah
sure
yeah
weather channel 's good
yeah
that 's about the only time in the summer if you 're watching t v for the weather even though it 's very hard to predict what 's going on
they 'll kind of say there 's a thunderstorm warning or whatever
this is what is expected
a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically so fast where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever
yeah
uh-huh
i can predict my week and where i 'm going to be
uh-huh
sure
i can be at the beach when the waves start coming in
to take off
sure
yeah
that 's
sounds pretty good
anyway i do n't know if our time is getting up here
it 's got to be fairly close to that
alright allen
the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of american women in the past several generations in the society we live in
what do you think has occurred there
i think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home
that 's probably one of the major changes i see over the last period of time
uh-huh
are they being given the full honor for the work they are doing what they have to accept that 's they are responsible for
responsibilities is what i am trying to say
i do n't think so
i think it has come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities
uh-huh
i still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals
in other words in some respects the other direction in some job markets they do n't really want to be treated as equals
by the same token in most cases women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who have been there before but at lower salaries
yes
i think that 's generally speaking pretty true
is that right and wrong
i think that 's what we really ought to look at that if they are going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay
yes
they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions
uh-huh
i do n't think that we have gotten there yet
yeah
what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years
any individual thing
is it just a general switch over
i think it 's generally that switch over
i think that switch over has been more in the work force
i do n't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force
i think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home that the husband is having them on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home
uh-huh
they have one and three quarters jobs now whereas the husbands have one and a quarter
yeah
this upsets the man because we have always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household
do you think that is going to be difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years
yes
yeah
i think also in terms of parenting
i think there is going to be some increasing problem because i think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting
i am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it
uh-huh
i think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units
do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation specifically
i think one of the things that always happens is i think is when the one end were moving out to the end where a lot of women will be at work
uh-huh
i think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties
the opinion of this career thing is n't all that it is cracked up to be
i want to go back and do something else
i think we will probably see the pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit
uh-huh
also much of it is driven by economics right now
yes
people have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in
i mo-
a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that 's what everybody else assumes they are going to get
yeah
the people
how do you feel about women in armed services
i think they ought to have the right
i have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife and my daughter going into combat
yeah
i have problems with men doing that
i guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it
it 's nothing i would be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for it
yeah
i somehow ca n't do that
i was brought up in the ages where the ladies were kept home safe secure and made happy
the men went out and took responsibility of earning the money bringing in whatever they needed and protected the household
it really still bothers me
i spent plenty of years in the service
it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or out in places where there is two or three of them there and five hundred men around
how are they going to protect themselves so to speak
i agree
it puts them in a very bad situation
i really do n't go for that
i think one of the other things that has concerned me a little bit
i think i see some change in attitudes there
my wife happens to be a wife who has chosen to stay at home
uh-huh
there 's has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who did n't have much intelligence because if she did she would be out in the work force fulfilling herself
yep
you 're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home going
i hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do that 's acceptable
yeah
if they chose to go into the work force that 's okay
yeah
if they chose not to that 's acceptable
if they go into the work force they should be treated as nicely as well as a man or any other person
as equals
not
