okay bill
as you think over the plans and so forth that the company you 're working with now
who do you work with at this time
i own the company
you own the company
all right
i 'm the president and c e o of the company
my goodness
i guess i determine what the benefits are
yeah
i guess you do
what are you asking me
what benefits i think are most important
what do you think of the
let 's put it this way
what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you other than their present salary
i 'd say in today 's economy besides basic benefits such as health insurance and life insurance and some type of retirement plan i 'd say that most of the employees that we have really like a profit sharing plan
uh-huh
a profit sharing plan
that 's interesting
uh-huh
they like to participate in the profits of the company like they 're
because they feel like we 're contributing to it
we 'd like to participate in it
that means i make a little bit less
the thing is that really you make a little more because everybody has a interest in it working
yes
they have a specific reason to do so because they themselves benefit from doing a better job
right
i think most people do n't want money
it 's been my experience most people want to feel like they 're participating in something that is not a drudgery that they enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of
uh-huh
it 's a contribution
right
bill that idea fits me exactly
i just retired from the university here
that 's been the goal in my life was to contribute to the work that i was doing in my research
that 's what made me happy
that 's the type of goal i think most people ought to look for
i 'm sure a lot of them do n't
you ca n't stand in front of a counter and do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that you 're contributing something to a scientific level of knowledge or so forth
yeah
our people get a lot of satisfaction
we 're a financial planning firm
you 're a financial planning firm
yes
how many
you said you retired
i just happen to have a person that i happened to do some planning for this morning we deal with a lot of people that are retired or trying to retire
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's real important that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work where they were that that it take care of them
they do n't
none of them really want to be rich
they like to have enough to be comfortable
what changes have you considered in doing it to your company that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better
we considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a salary is tie a percentage of business that a person would participate and bring into the company
pay them based on the percentage of business they bring instead of based on their salary
the re-
when you say bring in do you mean that they negotiated with people to come in and ask for your support
no
not necessarily
it can be in-house people who help you handle x amount of dollars
okay
uh-huh
even though they did n't bring it in they help it once it 's there
right we have marketing people
yeah
we have financial planners
we have staff secretaries and administrative assistants
these secretaries and administrative assistants if we do n't have their cooperation and they 're not participating in the profit of the company they can get very dissatisfied very quickly
uh-huh
we 're thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle
administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business
yes
it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job
it might be whether the locality there those people want that kind of support
to
the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they 're the assistant to or that they usually have several people they report to that they work together with it encourages them not to complain when they realize that they get a part of the action based on their efforts and not based on being sitting back saying make me do it
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
we do n't want anybody around here that says make me do it
i do n't think any
yeah
i think most people want to be lack of better terminology they want to be self-employed
they do n't want to take the risk
in other words they like to control their own future
they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please without some real strict adherence
that 's true
which
that 's what we have
uh-huh
okay do you like to cook
i love to cook as a matter of fact i 'm making dinner right now
really
what are you making
i 'm making some
i have a little turkey left from a passover whi- which was in april
uh-huh
i had frozen it
i 'm defrosting that and making some dressing and gravy and making corn and wheat stuff that you can buy at a store which is like rice pilaf
uh-huh
we
with with wheat kernel that
do you cook
are you single do you cook every night for yourself
no
i 'm married
the
my wife is a vegetarian
uh-huh
this is n't for her
this is for our friends that came over and helped me do some stuff
uh-huh
uh-huh
stuff
uh-huh
he and i
she 's having
i do cook virtually
i cook most of the time because i
uh-huh
if you were having a dinner party what would you cook a variety of things vegetarian and nonvegetarian
yeah
we consistently
if we cook
if we have a dinner party we usually make it vegetarian just to make life easier
uh-huh
we 'll make some sort of pasta or something homemade pasta or lasagna or something
uh-huh
yeah
that 's something that 's really easy
in fact i 'm having a dinner party next saturday
that is what i 'm having is pasta for christmas i got a pasta machine
good idea
what
all my friends are really anxious to have the homemade noodles
electric or
no
it 's the hand kind old fashion kind
best kind
that that that 's
we bought one in italy
uh-huh
that 's the best kind to have
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
that 's real good
yeah
that 's what i 'm going to be cooking
i thought i would
pasta salad first
then } just something for desert bread and wine and cheese stuff like that
that would be great
have you made pasta before
uh-huh
yeah
that it 's a lot of fun
yeah
yeah
i
a lot of people think though that i 've talked to about it think that it 's a lot of hard work
i said it 's kind of easy
it actually is if if you have a food processor
i do n't know if you have a food processor or not it turns out that i- if if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply
yeah
i do
uh-huh
right
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's also
people think it 's real hard
it just time consuming to get all of the little things right
uh-huh
otherwise it 's real
uh-huh
it 's good stuff
what other kinds of dinner parties do you serve
i do n't entertain that often
when i do though i have some friends that i always like to experiment on
i see a recipe and think i 'd really like to try this cause i 'm single
i live by myself
uh-huh
it 's not necessarily something that i would cook just for myself
right
you did n't want to cook
here we go
usually i 'm pretty good about it
that 's great
i have this really good recipe for this pork chop and apple casserole kind of thing
you put stuffing and put poached apples and everything
my girlfriend and her husband loved it in fact she passed it on to her parent
i was quite impressed with myself if i should say so
yeah
that 's of make it for one person as an experiment little bit and little here and there
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'm the kind of cook that i do n't normally measure things
i just kind of throw them in
i do n't to the point of measuring down to the exact amount that they say
that means you 're a real cook
is that what it means
uh-huh
it 's real good
uh-huh
yeah
we do middle eastern dinner quite a bit
uh-huh
no
i have n't
we make cause we 're my wife is syrian
uh-huh
her families always have this food she grew up in
i 've made some of it before as well
uh-huh
we make four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple
uh-huh
we put them out for people
that 's always a real big kick for people who 've never tried it before
uh-huh
that 's that 's that 's a fun idea if you ever want something different to try
uh-huh
i would try that
yeah
i 've been wanting to take an oriental cooking class
i just have n't gotten around to it yet
do you have a wok though
yeah
yeah
i stir fry things on occasion
i 'd like to know more about more elaborate things like guess
uh-huh
it 's easy
the food just comes out
if you do it right i think the food comes out very tasty not very mushy
uh-huh
it does n't taste like a million calories of oil
uh-huh
uh-huh
really
yeah
we we like to eat even when we eat out stuff we eat a lot of chinese food or japanese food or korean
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that seems to
wok food seems to be our thing
uh-huh
anything else you cook
i just kind of cook here cook there
i do n't have any one specialty
i 'm always willing to try anything usually
that 's good
that 's always the way to do it
i think
i especially like baking and making deserts
i 've taken a cake decorating class
the wilson course
no
no
it was a private course through a com-
that 's great
i have n't the wilson class
it 's it 's neat it takes a long time
it 's like you bake the cakes
i guess just because i do n't have the expertise to just hurry up and do it like a professional would i go real slow
right
it 's a little time consuming
uh-huh
it 's really worth your effort once you see how you do
yeah
yeah
we have
my brother can do it
uh-huh
he 's got a degree in business management
he learned how to do this
uh-huh
can you hold on one second
sure
thank you
sorry about that
that 's okay
some one kept beeping in our calling waiting
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
he does that a lot
he cooks a lot he bakes a lot whenever he
uh-huh
uh-huh
he made a real big cake himself
uh-huh
it was amazing
i never could do anything with cakes it 's just horrible
uh-huh
you learn helpful hints in the classes at least
yeah
i 'm
the instructor told us certain things about do n't follow what 's really necessarily on the box if you 're making just a cake from a box do this cause make it a variety yeah
that you mean about the mix itself
that helps
some different hints the different kinds of frostings you can make
i have a book an it
all of the different decorating tips an things like that
yeah
most frostings are sort of butter cream to are n't they * [ [ to = too
yeah
yeah
those kill me
it 's like i 'm eating sugar
they 're good sugar
yeah
i think part of the problem
yeah
yeah
that 's about it
yeah
i guess so
okay
it was a pleasure chatting with you
it was nice talking to you
yes
have a good time cooking for your dinner party next week
thank you
bye-bye
bye-bye
i 'll tell you why i feel so
i feel strongly about this topic
i do n't know a whole lot about the immigration laws
i do know that in the where i live and i teach school there are so many orientals that have come here
there 's a lot of mexican people too which is not neither here nor there
the fact is that all the orientals that are here are very affluent very wise in money matters and have taken over a lot of businesses
have
ki-
it 's kind of scary because they 're so bright
all the kids that i have that are oriental are really far above the american kids
they
the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up
money is their main goal
it really is kind of scary because there 's just oodles of them
you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by orientals
it 's kind of scares me not that i do n't want them here and not that i do n't appreciate the fact that they have rights too
on the other hand you feel like almost they 're invading us to the point where they 're going to take over
right
my son once said that perhaps what we should do is buy a little square of land some place in the midwest
that might be the solution
i think probably that 's
uh-huh
i was born in ohio
uh-huh
it really
there are a lot of mexican people here because we 're so close to the border
uh-huh
they are wonderful people
i do n't want to deny them their rights
just that you you feel like when you were born and raised here and you worked very hard to make this country what it is it scares you when you feel like somebody 's taking over
a lot of these people plan one day to go back to vietnam or to taiwan or wherever they 're from and take with them a lot of american dollars plus a lot of power in american com- companies
it 's kind of scary
uh-huh
uh-huh
i do n't know
i do n't know the immigration laws that
i do not
in fact i do n't know them at all
i do n't know how many people they allow in the united states per year or if there 's even a
i do n't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore
do you know anything about that
no
i do n't
i do n't know
i lived in the middle east for sometime
i do believe there must have been some sort of quota system because i know a lot of people that in a sense certainly were deserving to come
oh
uh-huh
it seemed to take them a long time
there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come
yeah
i would guess that there are quotas for different places
i would think so too
it
i i think there 's something about being able to claim imminent danger
i 'm not sure what the terminology is
uh-huh
uh-huh
maybe political a-
asylum of some sort
yeah
there you go
you got the term
uh-huh
maybe that 's an issue with a lot of people
i do n't know
i guess i have n't been in a situation where it 's been threatening to me
my kids go to school in another suburb of dallas with very very good school systems
they 're considered one of the top three in the state both of them
uh-huh
it seems like a lot of the orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools
uh-huh
they 're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here
the kids in this area are very bright and come from parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and very interested in their education
i think in the last year if i 'm not mistaken in four of the six high schools the graduating class valedictorian and salutatorian were half or more oriental
uh-huh
uh-huh
they 're just extremely bright kids
also they value learning
i was going to say i would guess that it 's not that they are any brighter
they just maybe work harder
i think things come easy for them too
i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the united states
they do n't want to work for anything
they want it to come to them and be there
they do n't want to work hard
these kids work really hard
right
right
may-
they have
maybe part of that 's the problem that here we 've let this value slip
yeah
i know
i agree with that
they need to have some competition
what i see is y-
the competition is there
instead of meeting the challenge they 're starting to resent them
uh-huh
it 's causing i think some problems
that 's too bad
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's mainly black and and hispanic
uh-huh
uh-huh
there has been some resentment with orientals in the black community because they 've started businesses there
the blacks resent them coming in and taking their money
there 's been some violence because of it
that 's really sad
it is
it is very sad
uh-huh
i really
i 've i 've always prided myself on not being prejudiced and welcoming everyone that wants to come here
uh-huh
even when i was younger when i was in college i was a member of the n a a c p because i lived up north
i was very into the human rights part of everything
uh-huh
i 've i 've become very cynical in the last three four years living in texas
uh-huh
it sounds like you feel that there is need for change
maybe the e-
there is too big of a concentration coming all at once to allow for adequate melting into the society
uh-huh
uh-huh
exactly
that 's exactly true
plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time two two three four maybe five years and then go back and pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them
plus a lot of american dollars
in the long run maybe that 's going to make a better world too
right
you just do n't know
exactly
an-
yet with
there 's somebody on my other line
i 'm going to ignore that
oh
i just
you kind of you don- you really do n't know what to do
i do n't
i want my kids to have values where they 're accepting and so forth
uh-huh
both of my children are really more tolerant of blacks and hispanics than they are of the orientals for some reason
they feel like they 've taken over
they feel like they 're taking some of the rewards that they should have
right
i really do n't want that to happen it 's happening
right
right
right
i think a lot of their friends feel the same way too
uh-huh
uh-huh
i really do wish i knew about quotas and really wish i
right
i would suspect that they have
i guess i do n't have much much more to contribute to the topic
yeah
i do n't really either
i wish i knew more
yeah
probably if i did i might be a little bit more tolerant perhaps
uh-huh
i
even if i really wish i knew the situations they were going back to or coming from
uh-huh
you do n't know any of that
you feel you ca n't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them
right
unless
for some reason orientals are very
my good friend calls them pushy
i call them very that
they know what they want
they go get it
uh-huh
in stores and so forth it 's wh-
goal directed
pardon me
goal directed
yeah
in stores and things sometimes they can be very impolite because they get in front of you or they take something that you had in mind to get before you did
oh
i see
just going for it they take it quickly
uh-huh
they do n't think anything of that
i do n't
that 's makes people resentful too yet they have a right to be here
sure
sure
i know that
uh-huh
it sometimes it 's gets touchy
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'm sure it 's a lot different
you 're from maryland you said
yes
what part of maryland are you from
up in the gaithersburg area
okay
my sister used to live there in that area
uh-huh
i 'm sure that it 's a lot different there
it 's a lot different in iowa than it is here
no
is that right
with some of the same problems that you 've mentioned
i do n't know
i guess i was n't involved enough to really stop to think about it
uh-huh
since i teach i see it
i feel
i love the example that most of these children give our american children
yet i can see why some of the parents are fearful too
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's a kind of a touchy situation
uh-huh
i wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened it does n't happen that way all the time
exactly
exactly
right
right
anyway
it was good talking to you
it was good to talk to you too
i h-
have a good trip in california
okay
have a good weekend
all right
thank you
all righty
bye-bye
bye-bye
what kind of books do you like best
i alternate between danielle steele is one of my very favorites
i try to go into one of the self improvement books
we take books every once in a while in our sunday school class and go through them
i love scott peck and his road less traveled it is wonderful
yeah
i 've heard of that one
i do n't think i 've read it
i thoroughly enjoyed that
what do you read
i 'm a tom clancy fan
okay
i read
i just finished a book on novelle netware
that 's computer stuff
i do a lot of computer reading
yes
i 'm just finishing another one up on statistical sampling
i do more work kind of related reading than just for enjoyment
i try to keep a book going all the time
i try to read when i first wake up in the morning and then before i go to sleep
i probably get thirty to fifty pages a day read
that 's pretty good
i just
i do n't feel like
in fact this morning i was almost late for work because i 'm almost at the end of this book
i did n't want to put it down
i 've had them like that before too
i like mysteries
mysteries
any particular writer
yes
i like { f oh
} i 'm drawing a blank
he wrote the bourne ultimatum
ludwig
lud-
ludwig yes
yes
i like jeffrey archer
he is an english author who writes some mystery
i guess they 're a type of mystery
they 're usually some p-
he 's a ex-lawyer
he 's a lawyer who no longer practices his have some part of the law enveloped in them
you kind of learn something as well as enjoy yourself
right
the new author that came out with the one that harrison ford starred in
raiders of the lost ark stuff
no
no
it was the
oh what time is it there ten thirty
it 's late
i 'm tired
i 'm not thinking too well
uh-huh
it 's nine thirty here
it was his first book
it was on the top of the list
he was a d a
presumed innocent
yes
i have n't seen the movie or read the book is she kind of racy
okay
he came out with the second one
a sequel to it
both of those i 've enjoyed real well
i like that
i love danielle steele
if i want to get a fantasy and get away from it all
no
no
she is n't at all
just feel good
her books
you always cry
really
it 's always good for good tears
one book that she wrote that 's good for both men and women is fine things
my mother-in-law 's a real fan of hers
it 's always going to make you have a good cry
you know it 's going it turn out good
you 're going to be happy in the end
that 's nice
i said
i do n't want anything too real anymore
i have enough of that in my own life
i want happy fantasy
yeah
you mentioned sunday school ladonna
uh-huh
do you
are you a bible fan too
i do my share of it
i certainly ca n't say that i understand a lot of it
yeah
that 's always a challenge
do you do
my wife talks with other people
okay
what are your opinions on it
let me preface it
i 'm a
i was a staff officer in vietnam in sixty-nine and seventy
uh-huh
i 'm in active reserve now
i 'm probably not going to have the you think i would have
uh-huh
it 's
i was an interesting in that i think that he gave the american people a sense of the fact that wars are really run by politicians * [ [ i > it
uh-huh
i
are you old enough to remember the war
n-
not much
i 'm twenty-eight
no
i really do n't remember anything about it
i guess i was about ten when it ended
right
yeah
i was born in sixty-two
when did it end
december seventy-two was when we bombed north vietnam and then they released the prisoners in early seventy-three in that time frame
yeah
i was ten
i do n't remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in great detail
i think the significant thing is today did you did you see barbara walters interview with schwartzkopf
no
i did n't
i did read the book
i ha-
do ha-
i have six years of college
i did read and study about the vietnam war though
i am pretty fa-
i 'm more
what 's your perspective on it
familiar with it than
mine
i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that i think it was the right thing to do to try and not to take away to and to get rid of some of the atrocities that were going to
i do n't know i do n't really
i 'm tired of pacifist though * [ [ pacifist > pacifists
on the other hand i 'm a pac-
i 'm really struggling with it
i believe that the real warfare is not with saddam hussein or the north vietnamese
it 's in spiritual kingdoms and that the real warfare is done in your prayer closet on your knees
in a way in a sense i 'm a pacifist
yes
i do n't think just lay back and not do anything
i think lets go to war * [ [ lets > let 's
let 's go to war praying
let 's go to war for that way
the difficulty i have is that are we our neighbor 's keepers
uh-huh
this is what i find particularly difficult in that if we see injustice and weather it 's in chicago * [ [ typo weather > whether or or dallas i think if we see it we see john wiley price hollering injustice i think that 's wrong
uh-huh
the question is was there injustice in vietnam
was there injust in iraq kuwait * [ [ typo injustice
uh-huh
uh-huh
the difficult point is to where do we step in
yeah
the the other part is the when your when your when your looking at vietnam and you say is fifty-eight thousand lives worth it * [ [ 3 typos your > you 're
uh-huh
still have a problem with
i have n't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this
i know other christians would disagree with me
my husband and i are kind of not even in agreement on this
we do n't fight over it or anything
how can
the bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you
it 's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind
it 's like how can you
i do n't know for me
i do n't know i ca n't say that i agree with vietnam because how can you be gentle unto all men and then shoot them
uh-huh
could you stand there and watch them beat that guy
if your brother or your sister were being beaten by the authorities do we step in
uh-huh
in some cases we would
i think that 's what makes it so difficult
yeah
it is a difficult thing
vengeance is mine sayeth the lord
i will pay
i think god is ultimately in charge of what goes on
i know like now in china he did all these terrible things * [ [ probably mao
they were terrible
he was going to be accountable for them
if you look back and you say wait a minute while he was in power he built roads he put in all the temples he unified the chinese language
it was impossible for missionaries to accomplish anything in china because of all that
even in north and south vietnam i bet you 'd see the same thing and that now he builds roads
it
he dropped dead twenty-five years premature he dropped dead
something good did come out of that in that now you see what i mean if like now
yeah
the other difficulty is that it 's just if you take the to feed my sheep and the question is who are my sheep
uh-huh
the idea do we go out and feed these people when they 're hungry
bless your enemies if your enemy is hungry feed him
if he asks for your shirt give him your coat also
if the the the south vietnamese they asked us to help them
right
is that right
yes
they did
i think the biggest difficulty is that when your at an economy like south vietnam then reality the the poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes * [ [ your > you 're
uh-huh
the question is who was he going to pay it to
yeah
the communists are all alleged democrats
uh-huh
democratic formed government
i think that 's i think i think that 's a little difficult part there
i
we did n't understand the culture
we could n't
we had a young lady that was fourteen that worked in the unit i was commander of that appeared to be eight or nine years old
the people looked like children
uh-huh
you could n't imagine that one would would conceal a bomb and do these kind of things
yeah
i think socially it really destroyed a lot of the people that went over and saw these people
you just could n't believe that they would be mean and and and drop bombs and kill people we would turn around and them * [ [ typo napalm
uh-huh
if
uh-huh
i think there was a lot of tearing of emotions
i think that if anything that when he was saying the idea that we learned we learned a lot from vietnam
uh-huh
it was in general bad
i do n't know the problem is now
i 'm concerned a little bit that now that the gulf war is on that we 're going
i think it was a good war
it was okay to go beat up on people
yeah
i think we need a little more justice at home
i 'm not sure how we get that
wonder if there 's a connection there
yeah
again yeah
i 'd say it is wrong to
i 'm not saying president bush made the wrong decision
i think i 'm lacking in my
i do n't think i can come to a complete conclusion on how i feel about the vietnam war because i 'm going to interpret that through the bible
i 've kind of always
i 've been a christian five years
i 've kind of avoided that those the war things and how god approaches that because i think it 's just now coming up to where i really feel like i need to decide what i feel
the difficulty
that was part of the problem when they went into the promise land * [ [ should be promised land that they they did n't destroy everybody
yeah
right
they left a woman and the sheep
yeah
you
i think that 's one of those things when we get to heaven we 're going to ask god
i know
why did you do it that way
again though the grace pushes you beyond the law you know what i 'm saying
he did n't just say do n't kill your enemies
not only do n't kill them bless them
what can we do to rectify this situation
that god would move in that sovereignly
he would get the glory though no king no
bush would n't because it would n't make any sense you know what are i 'm saying
yeah
it would look absolutely ridiculously stupid
it would work out because if you follow the scriptural principals it 's going to work out because that 's the best way to do it * [ [ spelling = principle
the thing is that then god gets the glory not a president not a king
i think that 's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory
i
even at the local level when somebody 's assaulted what do you do turn the other cheek
uh-huh
n-
i believe personally
i ho-
i woman always says my husband always goes three that i guess
yeah
if somebody broke in my house i would pray that i would have this faith to take authority over that
i know people that have done that
i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes and just say i bind you in jesus name
your
n-
i just
rebuke any enemy because i believe it 's a spiritual war that 's going on
it 's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home
that 's not normal
there 's something going on there and that i would have discernment by the holy spirit to deal with pride over that
do you see what i mean
yeah
the same in vietnam you would n't handle vietnam the same way you would handle saddam houssein * [ [ hussein
i have a problem with all the killing
i 'm not a new ager i do n't believe
i am not for one world government
i 'm not for all these new age things
i i do n't have a problem with national identity
i 'm an american
having different nations and all of this
i 'm concerned about the killing that went on there because i just feel like god has a better way to handle it than that
i 've had time to think about it because we 've had
i-
i-
there 's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to i was thinking about a couple things and whether they are serious
okay
uh-huh
some things are serious
some are n't
i guess the biggest thing that bothers me is
uh-huh
not the biggest thing
one of the things that bothers me is the credit information situation that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any sort of credit extensive checks and things of that nature
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
when
i do n't know if that 's an invasion of privacy simply i do t- i do feel it is
i do n't know whether some of the questions they ask are legitimate because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your
uh-huh
uh-huh
what 's scary is about two three four months ago in the sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here the dallas morning news
uh-huh
they showed a reporter and a copy editor how they went out
they just took a fellow in john q public in dallas
all they had was
let 's see they had something like his birth date the street address
they were n't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name
it was very scary to see what they found out
they were able to find out what liens he still had against two or three houses through two divorces children 's names locations
it was really frightening
i guess then it 's just the big brother concept of the fact that once you give your social security number there are people i guess who are actually collecting all this all the time
uh-huh
yeah
i understand
i read the other day that these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone all they need now is your telephone number which i guess is involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
i i feel that is an invasion of privacy
it
i do too
yeah
the other thing i do n't like is in terms of
we just moved here from minneapolis
to get the very nice townhouse that we 're in you were required by the property management firm that was representing a private landlo-
yeah
husband and wife owners who had never done this before
they asked us for again an astounding amount of information
what we really did n't have the same opportunity
i guess that 's when i also get upset that if you 're going to do it then i want to do it too
yeah
exactly
in terms of the credit
yeah
i know we 're also going through adoption now
yeah
in for an adoption
after we gave our fingerprints to the f b i you look at each other you look at each other and say it 's too late now
it 's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try
yeah
i have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me
uh-huh
go ahead
b-
i make my living by flying airplanes for a company
uh-huh
uh-huh
as an airline pilot i have to take random drug testing
uh-huh
it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time
when i finish a certain flight on a random basis i have to have a drug test
uh-huh
that 's without probably cause
uh-huh
a- in the end now they 've spent forty million dollars
it is n't
they 've found i think in pilots anyway of something like eighty-six thousand tests there 's only been three guys have come up positive
one of them was a bad test
positive for anything
yeah
i just started working for an electronics firm down here
i used to be a reporter
yeah
now i 'm in corporate communications
yeah
part of that was as a new hire that i had to take a drug test
drug test
righ-
i had never been asked that
i thought i really did n't like it
i have very mixed feelings about it
i do n't disagree or agree with you
yeah
i think that it 's well
you 're in that field
i do n't know
it 's
we lived in minneapolis when the northwest airlines pilot in the dakotas
yeah
right
yeah
that hit the fan like
you 're obviously aware of that
yes
i am
i do n't know there should be some happy medium in terms of
if they 're going to do random
i do n't agree with random
yeah
i do n't see a problem with that
i do think i see some level of necessity in something where people are transporting other people only because of the things you 've heard about
the problem is
the reason i feel that way even to a low degree is because it 's the old story the minority make it bad for the majority
yeah
i can understand the public 's alarm to it
yeah
i 'm not alarmed
i guess having done this all my life i knew that there was n't a problem
indeed it has proved out that way
now try to get the damn thing repealed
you ca n't
yeah
i know it 's
i guess i feel bad because
not only that
in some of the instances you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints what what happens if you say no
if you say no then you 're excluded
i
does n't seem the courts
right
right
it 's a matter
that 's exactly what it is
yeah
that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion
if we did n't give it we would n't go to romania
that 's right
if
you hate to say that
that 's the way it is
it 's my feeling also that that although
i do n't know if it 's that serious
that was part of the question
uh-huh
i do feel the courts have held up a great deal of our privacy particularly look in some of the in some of the
uh-huh
i notice in some of the sexual cases they 've held up a great deal of privacy which i support of course
uh-huh
it i guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that it does seem that we 've slipped and that 's eroded
at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that it 's fair game
t-
you have to answer these questions of course
uh-huh
i do n't know
i feel there has been an erosion
i do n't really know how serious it is except i do n't like it
in terms of the privacy yeah
that in it
also i agree with that
in terms of the question in terms
i worked in medical public relations for almost a decade
that was pre-aids and all the other things that were probably there but just not labeled
i have a real problem with medical professionals
it goes back to the things like drug screening
if it 's in any level even with the potential to endangerment
uh-huh
i think this is much stronger than pilots or train engineers being screened
yeah
the transmission of the aids virus
i-
i-
that 's a real ethical problem
i do n't have the answer
i mean } i think of the young girl in florida who
yeah
that 's
was she from your part of the country
was she from
what was that
the young girl that contracted aids through her dentist allegedly
yeah
yeah
yeah
they proved it
yeah
right
i do n't know i do n't know if it 's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general or what
it
just take that step where now we feel there 's a need to do that
the next thing you know then there 's always the need to go and inspect lockers of high school students
uh-huh
tha-
yeah
the
i guess the question is
the thing for me is who sets the parameters or who has the control
yeah
i guess so
good luck to you
you just moved to texas from minneapolis i do n't hold out much hope for you
yeah
yeah
i think they 'll be a cultural shock
i was based there a lot several times in the service
i was absolutely flabbergasted at the
in at least in criminal law some of the latitudes that the police had
it 's ter-
i 'm
very seriously
no-
more than just seriously
i 'm more than likely going to be going to law school in the fall
oh yeah
yeah
if i figure out that 's still what i really want to do
the things i 'm finding out are in terms of things privacy the way the law is interpreted presented
yeah
it 's no better than journalism except in journalism it 's words
this is very frightening in that
in texas they d- they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents whether it 's domestic or international
they 're one of only five states that do not require a criminal investigation check
yet if you 're caught with
let 's just say that somebody who 's in ne-
not us
somebody who 's need of carting aluminum beer cans around
they have n't touched them
they have n't drank them
they picked them up off the street
they want to take them to a recycling resource for money or whatever
they 've been going through a lot of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again because they 've been arresting people like that
i do n't understand
if you do n't
if they do n't make a criminal check why do you have to be fingerprinted
in our case one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level because you have to deal with the i n
yeah
because you have to deal with the imi- immigration service
i see
the state does n't require it
that 's rather unusual is n't it
yeah
it is
it 's
the whole thing is
again there 's no consistency
in your
in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly i ca n't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they ca n't do it at an interval
i guess the extension of that is why not
the next thing you know we 'll just stop a random amount of motorists
if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street
they do that in texas
they do
they do n't do it for drugs
what they do is they check to see if you 've got current insurance
they check to see if you 're permits are
yeah
there 's all sorts of scare tactics i guess to to invade our privacy
yeah
i know
it 's kind of
what 's the word i want
i do n't
it 's ju-
to me it 's just frightening
yeah
the old
i 'm old enough now where george orwell
way past time
i just going to say nineteen eighty-four is come and gone
yeah
it 's here
yeah
it 's exactly true
i
the computers of course helps that
the computer abilities store that information
look at what we 're talking now
it 's
look how we 're talking now
you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger
okay i guess we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time
uh-huh
i basically read books
uh-huh
it is
i do
sometimes when everybody 's gone to bed my kids are in bed and my husband in bed
i will just stay up and finish a book that i am
i have about three books that i am going on
i will work on one for a little bit and then the next one
that 's just kind of
that is pretty impressive to have three books going
not always
just sometimes
yeah
what what kind of books do you read
just really different ones
i have one that i was reading on raising your children and then another one on an autobiography and another one on like a crime story
yeah
a true crime story
do you like those detective stories
yeah
this
it was a true one
it was just a little different though
reading that one last night
that is interesting
i like to read also
usually fall into one or two categories true science fiction fantasy on the one hand highly technical
yeah
like my husband
yeah
yeah
yeah
kind of one or the other
you must work for t i
yes
yeah
my husband does too
yeah
i am a computer scientist
yeah
i have a lot of other hobbies
uh-huh
really
yeah
i am kind of i guess what you would call a project person
really
yeah
i love
i have a shop
when things break around the house i always try to fix them myself
hobby
it 's funny
from the one stand point it is work
it is a hobby too that i enjoy to do
yeah
to find broken
yeah
yeah
what kinds of things do you fix
essentially anything you find in a house a stove or oven or a broken piece of porcelain or chipped tile on the floor just anything
oh
you have a shop
it is not anything elaborate
it is just a work bench and a gazillion tools
yeah
enough that again for anything in the house i could probably
yeah
you can fix just about everything and anything
right
that is great
in the car
i guess the car too
yeah
i think i probably would consider that a hobby
although sometimes it gets to be excessive
yeah
that is pretty much like my husband
he is pretty mobile in that area too
he works on the cars
he rarely takes them in
yeah
i
he works on irons and all t vs and stuff too
we rarely have to take those things in too
right
yeah
i think it
not only can it be fun
it can certainly help your finances
yeah
yeah
definitely
do you have any creative or artistic hobbies
not really
during christmas i work on like holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things
yeah
good
not really
yeah
i do n't necessarily either
i can plink out a song or two on a piano
oh
i can
i do n't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art
i guess graphic arts is that what they call it
yeah
yeah
i ca n't do any of that
sweat shirts is certainly impressive
uh-huh
i belong to this organization if you have preschool children
uh-huh
every once and a while they will have a craft section for the moms
yeah
those are really neat
we learn to do the transfer pictures on the sweatshirts transfer photos
yeah
uh-huh
those are really neat
we learn different crafts like that
i see
that is neat
yeah
i guess you could consider that a hobby
do you cook for a hobby
do you
no
i cook dinner
that 's not something you
i do n't consider it a hobby
i understand that
i
no
i am not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately
yeah
i like to bake off and on
usually once a week i will bake something
it 's not anything elaborate
right
at least i do n't think it is
yeah
i think that still borders on hobby
yeah
probably the other thing i do which i am sure will sound horrible to you is i program for fun on the computer
uh-huh
i have little computer projects going on that i consider hobbies
uh-huh
drive my wife crazy
oh
good
you have a computer at home
i do
yes
good
yeah
in fact there is actually several of them here right now
really
not all of them being mine
wow
then you are busy
yeah
uh-huh
that is very good
i wonder if you can construe raising children as being a hobby
you know one of the books that i was reading
i stopped because it was so
it 's
the book is so detailed
uh-huh
you have to
sometimes i have to go back and read the page over again cause i did n't quite get it all
it is so detailed
okay
i have n't been in this situation yet
my parents are not quite at that age yet
i have n't
they 're not quite elderly
no
i have n't really been in that situation although they are thinking about my grandmother that 's really about it
uh-huh
how about you
have you been in that situation yet
not for my parents
i was around two sets of grandparents quite a bit
we i put one grandfather in a rest home
uh-huh
that killed him
did it
yeah
kind of
there was some other things involved
it
before he was really active
the
there was some
he lost his drivers license
could n't get around and was n't able to do some things
we ended up just having to put him in a rest home
yeah
he just kind of became a vegetable and died that was a long time ago
no
that 's sad
yeah
that was back in like seventy-three
okay
i think the way they did things were a lot different back then
i 'm sure they were
yeah
my grandmother his wife we also put her in a rest home
uh-huh
she was in a rest home
she was back out because she did n't really need to be there physical had a good physical therapist at that place they worked with her and got her walking and got her kind of taking care of herself she was able to come back home
ah
yeah
{ c and then } she had to go back in a couple of times
oh
mostly it was just because she kind of gave up
they got her going again
yeah
i guess as far as looking do things with them and treat them like
uh-huh
yeah
i 'm sure it 's expensive
yeah
it is
yeah
it is expensive
yeah
my grandmother is not in a nursing home
she 's in a
uh-huh
they 're apartments for senior citizens
uh-huh
she loves that because they arrange activities for them all day long
uh-huh
they have where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go
she she really does love that
uh-huh
she 's just wondering what 's going to happen to me
when she ca n't take care of herself
i
{ d you know i guess it 's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she does n't need that
uh-huh
she 's kind of asking questions about what 's going to happen this ca n't last forever
uh-huh
does she have a
is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to
yeah
she can go down to the cafeteria
yeah
she can
uh-huh
because i remember in her letters telling me she 'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat
i 'm assuming it 's something like that too
uh-huh
yeah
i really like that concept
uh-huh
they have quite a few of those places like that here in utah
couples can
husband and wife can live there too or whatever
i
yet they have their friendships and relationships and the of getting together and eating together and all of that
yeah
yeah
i think it really takes looking more at the people than even really the facilities
uh-huh
she lives by herself too
she seems to like it
uh-huh
my husband 's grandmother is
she lives in a house on her own
she does n't really need the care or anything like that
she has her own home
she 's doing really well
i 'm really proud of her
she 's doing really well
we have n't had to do anything
then again she has a lot of support she 's got her mother in town too and things like that
yeah
yes
i think that that 's the thing that 's a little bit scary a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it 's almost like
that they say putting them out to pasture
some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active
yeah
they wanted to do things
they did n't want to go down and play bingo or play with the oranges
i 'll tell you my situation is i have an elderly grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home
her son which is my father is also elderly
this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years
my father 's almost eighty
my grandmother 's almost ninety-seven
jeez
it 's strange because it hit so close to home that my father 's an only child
really me and my sister are the only ones that will deal with my grandmother
she had many sisters
a couple of them took care of her
one her last sister died
it was probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home because i was pretty much giving up my life my sister was and plus she was driving my father crazy
she went through three live-in housekeepers
she 's kind of cranky to get along with
there 's nothing physically wrong with her except she 's very very old
her personality is very grating
i hope i do n't get like that when i get old
yeah
i 'm i have some great concerns about my parents and my relatives reaching that age
around here where i live in maryland in the washington area there 's
i used to live down in dallas there was just so many stories about rest homes where the people are being abused where the people are being kept in filthy conditions
in fact here in baltimore they 've actually shut a couple of them down and taken all the people out of them because they were so bug infested and rat infested
i
it really concerns me that first of all that anyone could let someone live like that
if you have to how do you make sure
i 'm sure when you make your appointment and go by everybody puts on a happy face
how are you sure that the home is really as good as it is because once you put someone into there they may not like the fact that they 've been put in there
they might complain about the place all the time even though it 's the best place in the whole world they could be just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there
yeah
you do n't know if their complaints are legitimate
yeah
we do n't have that problem up here
we might maybe in a rural
maybe there 's a bad home in a rural area
it would be a very small one
the one my grandmother 's in is very hospital like
there were some really nice ones here
all the
a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations
this one is more or less for someone who 's poor and ca n't go there
my father 's he 's no by no means wealthy
he 's quite well off
uh-huh
he could easily have put her into a nicer home
up here there 's waiting lists
that was the first one that opened
i suggested to him why do n't you change
he said these people they are very nice to her
he was saying his excuses if you move her some place else the people might not be so nice
the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it 's a really trying job
i go up twice a week to see my grandmother
i know the staff very well
they ca n't hide anything on you or anything like that
uh-huh
i have heard of really awful conditions especially down the southern part of the the country which is
yes
that 's true
my grandmother 's
last time my mother went down there to visit the place where my grandmother was staying at was so overrun with roaches that they went in and she had roaches crawling on her
there were roaches even in her alarm clock
that 's terrible
yes
it was absolutely horrible
they took her immediately out of there
they just threw everything away that she had from there
they would n't even take the the dresser that she had that was her own dresser because it was just full of bugs
they just left everything and bought her all brand new stuff
they had called a home where they were on a waiting list to get into there and explained to the person that was in charge what had happened and that they had to take her out of the home because of the conditions
amazingly enough the very next day they had an opening
they put her into that opening
that 's good
is your grandmother impaired
is she of alzheimer 's or something like that
i 'm not sure what exactly is wrong with her
up until nineteen eighty-two
i 'm sorry not until
yeah
i guess it was around eighty-two eighty-three i found out i had a grandmother
oh
prior to that i was told that she was dead
apparently what had happened was that i had a grandfather who put her into a mental institution
that does happen
yeah
it was a real hush-hush thing
yeah
i was wondering why my mother always referred to his second wife as that hussy
my neighbors across the street their mother was sick at times
they could n't handle her
they put her in a home
the old frenchman he 'd get a little drunk look round at his kids you still need your mother
that happens a lot when people are sick or they just real manic-depressants they end up being put in homes
it 's like
yeah
that 's
it 's
i 'm really glad that i come from an area where there 's good people in the homes
it 's just as
it does n't matter if it is like you say the best place they still do n't want to go to these homes
my grandmother 's real there
she cries every day
this has been over a year
she tries to make me feel really guilty
i have to put my foot down where my life begins
if that was my mother i would really feel a lot more responsible
i would probably take care of my mother
i do n't really
when my father when something
if anything happens to him i do n't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i do n't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home
hopefully that he can get along with in-house help
he 's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day because i think that 's the best situation is when you get that old and you 've been independent your whole life you do n't want to go into a home because like i say my father 's eighty
he 's really active
he still has his driver 's license here
you would n't believe what he does
he actually tows cars
as the years go on the tow trucks got better more easier
he went out and bought himself a flat bed one
he wo n't have to do very much work
someone like that i really do n't want to see them go in a home
he 's got two dogs that are his constant companions
he always replaces them
over the past thirty years i 've had about seven or eight different dogs all the time
it 's like
it 's
dad 's got these two
the old dies
the young one goes for a while
he gets another one
i ca n't see him without his animals
even though it 's very expensive to stay at home mentally it 's just the best thing for you
yes
i know
when you get on in your years it 's the only thing you really have
i 'm thinking when i get older i i think if brought all my precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home
i do n't want to be selfish a burden on anyone
that 's what i think because i see what my grandmother puts me through
i 'm saying that when i get older i could probably make the best of this place
of course it 's institutional food
everybody hates it
it 's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight
yeah
it 's a bad thing
when they go into the homes they lose weight and because of the institutional food
i think it 's fine
my taste buds are pretty flexible
here they 're always used to these old fashioned foods
they 're very set in their ways and used to have what they could get at home
now they 're feeding them quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat
yeah
just
they do n't feed them the old people food the chicken and biscuits and things like that
that 's the thing my grandmother really misses really growls about
yeah
my mother has made similar statements that she does n't want to become a burden to the family
just put me out to pasture shoot me or something
are the lines that come from her i tell her no problem mom always got a place for you
oh
yeah
i know if if people would think ahead of time and do things like that like build the in-law apartment and have it on one floor and really easy access
that 's what i 'm telling my father now
he needs a new floor in his bathroom
you can get in and out
there a lot of places to camp in dallas
not necessarily in dallas
it 's a very short drive to areas near here
uh-huh
do you do a lot of camping
i have done camping in the past
i ca n't remember when the last time i actually went camping was
it was several years ago
i did most of my camping in the mountains
uh-huh
that must have been fun though
it is
i enjoy hiking and camping
we went to the
i have some land there
it 's handy to station yourself there on the land and then make trips up into the mountains for backpacking and hiking and overnight camping
uh-huh
that sounds fun
do you do most of yours in tents
yeah
we 've done ours
i 've only been camping twice
wow
one of them i do n't really consider camping
it was on the edge of the lake
it was at a camp
i do n't like those camping grounds where you got r v beside you and then another people in tents beside you
uh-huh
uh-huh
i just do n't care for that
no
i agree with you
i think it 's much nicer when you can really get out far enough away where that you ca n't see people right out the window
uh-huh
right
it does n't
we
four years ago
it was about four years ago my little boy was three months old
the first time i left him we went overnight camping
uh-huh
we went and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake
we had a ball
uh-huh
just sat out there with our
we did n't even use tents then
we just had sleeping bags and fire going
uh-huh
we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning
does n't that always taste so much better when you 're out like that
it did
it did
yeah
i did n't even think about frying potatoes
my sister-in-law she 's always done a lot of camping
uh-huh
she 's good
she 'd think about bringing a rake so you can rake your area out
yeah
that 's right
if you do n't you 'll find every rock on it [ when you put your when you put your bag down
uh-huh
sh-
yeah
she is always prepared
she brought everything from like i said toilet paper to the rake
the only thing we 'd had to do we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill
uh-huh
we we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped
uh-huh
we broke the i guess it 's the freezing component
uh-huh
we broke that out of there and put it over our hole
what a clever idea
yeah
i would n't have thought about that
it held our pan and the potatoes and stuff
we had a good time
that 's a good idea
yeah
we 're still waiting to go again
uh-huh
if you get a chance
there are some really nice camping areas up in the wichitas which is in oklahoma and arkansas
uh-huh
arkansas
i ca n't remember the name
it 's on the oklahoma-arkansas border
uh-huh
it wo n't take but just a quick look at a map to find where those mountains are
uh-huh
i took a drive up through there as a matter of fact last september just took the drive through to see what was there
uh-huh
they have some wonderful camping areas there
pretty
beautiful beautiful country
i love to swim
i like to get out by a lake or a somewhere close where we can swim
uh-huh
yeah
right
lake tawakoni is a pretty nice place
uh-huh
we had a two bedroom mobile home there
the boys still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and build a little fire and roast their marshmallows until the mosquitos bit and then they came in
uh-huh
yeah
how old are your boys
they 're grown now
they do n't go camping with you
they go camping on their own
oh
once you start them they enjoy it all their lives
yeah
i have n't taken my little boy yet
uh-huh
i 'm afraid to get him out
he is so fearless it terrifies me
uh-huh
he
do n't be concerned
there 's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere
think so
uh-huh
it 's the water he 's not scared of
he 'll go out into it until it 's up to his nose and then try to back
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's easy to keep him occupied though on land
i know that i took my kids we 'd go out
i 've them walk with me along the lakefront
uh-huh
we 'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell and finding the biggest shell
we 'd hunt pine cones we climbed some pinon pines one year and gathered the cones so that we could eat the pine nuts
uh-huh
uh-huh
we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out
we + we searched for
uh-huh
we ate the wild plants
we gathered wild berries
it 's really
yeah
the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find
if you know what to look for
uh-huh
i had my boys build their own little three leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark
that sounds so neat
we cooked in a pot
i baked them a cake right there on a camp fire
they were so impressed
yeah
i used a tire chain and the bottom of a dutch oven
i 'm impressed
my mother-in-law
my
they 've always done a lot of camping
i grew up in louisville kentucky
there was n't
i do n't know
we just did n't get out
my mother and my father split up when we were young
my mother was n't into that
that 's who i stayed with
uh-huh
we did n't do much outdoors stuff except swimming
uh-huh
we went swimming a lot
uh-huh
my baby 's getting sick
uh-oh
i know
if our time is up we can quit
yeah
i 've got to clean her up
i 'm sorry
appreciate it
okay
uh-huh
i enjoyed talking
thank you
you bet
bye-bye
bye-bye
okay
what is your opinion on drug testing
i can see it in certain cases where somebody 's in a position that perhaps a lot of lives are involved like maybe pilots that fly jets
maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people
i could certainly see it being done
in general
whether companies want to do this
i know that companies do
like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested
i know a couple of corporations that are doing that
they kind of have gotten into the idea that let 's drug test them and let 's put them through rehab
there 's got to be a limitation
do we drug test everybody that comes in
do we kind of say well you can be drug tested
you look okay because you look this way
you 're very conservative
there 's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs
the guy that does n't fit the stereotype of the conservative or whatever could be drug tested
whether legal rights of that person
i do n't know
there 's certainly a lot of things to really consider when you get into drug testing people just at the work place unless of course like i said they have a large responsibility over a mass of people
that 's about it
yeah
it it 's just not the com-
you 're talking about company 's liability
uh-huh
uh-huh
if if the company is liable for something that that a employee does while under the influence of a drug then by all means they should have the right to to to + to minimize their liability
sure
sure
i think that 's what companies are doing more and more because there are products that are out there
there 's also the case about just health and welfare of the employees
uh-huh
if a company has a healthy work force their insurance rates are low
exactly
sure
sure
not only low there 's all sorts of a financial benefits associated with having people file fewer claims being sick
sure
exactly
the only thing is
the whole question that a that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy
i do n't think anybody would argue with that
exactly
exactly
the only thing is
the one issue that i would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive
right
if they have had medications in the past let 's say once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe that week they take an advil
the advil will apparently come out positive as if they smoked marijuana
right
there 's poppy seed type things
i think that everybody is aware of that
where 's the line where you say to somebody i 'm going to drug test you tomorrow
please do not take these medications
where 's how you can do it
wel-
the ques-
right
the question becomes what do you do about somebody who tests positive
exactly
d-
that 's where the real sticking point comes in
uh-huh
it 's not
i do n't think there 's any problem with testing people
sure
it 's what do you do with the information
sure
exactly
an-
the only thing that i would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on
let 's say you 've taken medication of some sort even though they usually have you at the time list what medications you 've taken
let 's say you do come out positive
you 've taken advil or any of the ibuprofen products out there
you 've had a cold
you 've been on medication or whatever
you come out positive
is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well this is kind of iffy
are they really on drugs
they on drugs
you know what i 'm saying
where there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person is on drugs
right
they may make up their mind that let 's get rid of this employee
you know what i 'm saying
right
yeah
i think clearly the person who is the line manager
uh-huh
the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing
that should go to an entirely different agency within a corporation
exactly
it 's a
they can that the
if it does come out positive the first time they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take
you know what i mean
it 's kind of like
i think most people are aware at least now common knowledge is that
okay
you ready to discuss the topic
what 's the topic
okay
the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in america and how they relate or how they differ today than they were ten fifteen or thirty years ago
okay
you ready for that
you bet
okay
i 'll let you lead out
pardon me
i 'll let you lead out
okay
there 's
it 's kind of an interesting topic
one that i think is quite fascinating because couple of years ago i guess
not very long ago seemed like the whole world not just the united states but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in a very comfortable position so to say even though the cold war was in full swing
you had the the russians against the americans the communists against the free world
in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically not only on the political front but also on the economic front where couple of years ago america was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned
now we 're having a very tough time in a recessionary period
we 're also have a very humongous trade deficit
that 's kind of frightening
also a couple of years ago fifteen ten fifteen years ago an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life
thirty years ago that was basically it whereas now we 're expected to have a career change every couple of years and possibly four to five career changes throughout our lifetime
i think things
there 's been an awful lot of social change lately
we-
i think one of the things that 's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that they seem to be economically driven also
uh-huh
uh-huh
if you look at russia and what 's happened over there i think the change in communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing
of course i look at the economic problems in the united states right now
one of the things you wonder is what that 's going to do to us
true
i think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things i think it 's great to even have three or four different careers in your life
uh-huh
i think it must have been terribly boring to go through your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years
yes
yes
some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that aspects changing
true
true
the uncertainty of whether you 're going to have a job is not as good
the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs
uh-huh
do you think that 's good or bad
i think it 's great
you think that 's great
yeah
that 's some
yeah
because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position
they 're very comfortable
they lose the ability to learn
they in a sense become unteachable
they think they know all there is to know in the area set path and come in and put my time in from nine to five
when that 's over with that 's it without even giving a second thought to advancing their education or getting extracurricular education
i think that 's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also
i think one of the problems with education as it relates to this though is that i do n't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes
it just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes which i think is going to be a hard thing for people to face
uh-huh
right
i agree with that
i agree with that
i believe that an individual should really learn how to learn
yeah
learn how to adapt
learn how to grow in their college or whatever education they might take
that 's good
that 's good
there probably needs to be some training on how to to adjust to these changes as they come about
if you look at the high unemployment rate right now
you look at people who are in those situations i do n't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them even ideas of how to make those changes now
uh-huh
it seems to me that while those changes are taking place maybe we 're not well preparing people to make the changes with them
yeah
i read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now
uh-huh
that stress is a very prominent factor in the work place
it affects
i 'm in
like i said i 'm in minneapolis
the big thing up here of course is the twins
i imagine you ca n't escape it
no
it 's pretty pervasive
it kind of goes into about all aspects of society i think up here
i do n't know how much of the world series you caught last year
that was a lot of fun
of course it was fun for you
to be honest with you i 'm not from minneapolis
in fact i 've only been up here a few months
i 'm going back at the end of next month
to
orlando florida
really
i 'm not exactly a real twins fan from birth or anything
i was born and raised near miami and spent the last twenty years in dallas where the rangers played
yeah
oh
uh-huh
for the last roughly year i 've been in san francisco where there are two teams the oakland as and the san francisco giants
right
honestly i do my duty and watch the sports on the newscasts
okay
that 's about all the exposure i have to sports
yeah
i have n't followed it real closely at all except like i said last year when the world series rolled around i did follow that pretty religiously
went out into the bars drank a beer watched the game had a good time that way
uh-huh
sure
i guess the san francisco giants and the oakland as were the leading teams a couple of years ago
is that right
i th-
i do n't know
that 's sort of what i gather
uh-huh
i do n't know
what is the prognosis for this year
real good as far as i can tell
people are pretty excited about it
good
i assume that means good for the minnesota
yeah
sorry about that
yeah
as far as the twins are concerned it seems to be real good
my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago
they won that one seven to one
that 's pretty good i guess
it looks like they 'll be doing pretty well
are you still there
yep
okay
i heard some noise on the line
did n't know what happened
i think a train went by
okay
all right
i know a train went by
i do n't know what the noise was
i think it probably was the train
yeah
i do n't know
i i do n't even know who has been winning as far as the san francisco giants and the oakland as
i think they both won their opener
i sort of gathered that in my subliminal memory
uh-huh
maybe that has good tidings for their season coming up
i 've got a friend that 's living in san francisco right now
he 's doing the same thing i 'm doing which is basically an internship
we 're both doctoral students
he 's doing his with i b m
huh
i 'm doing mine with honeywell
i think he kind of follows the sports
i think he 's mentioned the oakland as a couple of times he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good
uh-huh
i guess they are different leagues
is that right
the as
as far as i know
yeah
in the major leagues i guess there is a couple of different divisions
of course there 's the minors
i do n't know
i guess i 'm one of those people that if i really made a concentrated effort i could really probably get into baseball
uh-huh
i was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago right after that game
he offered to take me to one of the games because apparently he and four other people from honeywell had bought a row of seats for the home games
uh-huh
uh-huh
the thing is there 's like eighty-six home games per year
there 's no way that you can ever use them all
eighty-six
eighty-six
i was amazed to hear that
huh
that 's just the home games
i thought it was a mistake
he goes no
they must play every day then
yeah
well just about
yeah
i mean eighty-six times two is a hundred sixty
yeah
that 's
yeah
that 's almost
that 's over five months worth
that 's a lot of baseball
even if they play every day that 's over five months worth
yo- if you consider it the season starts
it 's
the season started about a week and a half ago
it ends with the world series which usually takes place i believe in december or january
no
yeah
i think so
it did last year did n't it
was it november
that was the super bowl
maybe it was november i 'm thinking about
i know it was doggone cold up here
i do n't feel so bad
i think you do n't know all that much more than i do about baseball
i know for sure it was
i see
okay
it was at least two months after i got up here
really
okay
yeah
it had to be november anyway
i know the super bowl
okay
are you a fisher person are you
yes
i love to fish
great
what kind of fishing do you do
it 's mostly from the rivers and lakes
in california
and yes
and from the banks
i do n't like to go out on boats
oh
what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods
it
uh-huh
oh
i like it all except i do n't really care that much for the trout
i think i had rather have a catfish than i would a trout
i do n't blame you
i grew up in nebraska and grew up cat fishing in the little blue river
we moved to south dakota and did a lot of walleye fishing on the missouri river
uh-huh
now that we are down here i think a lot of people do some bass fishing and strip bass fishing
i am sort of a catfish man at heart
like in iowa and nebraska those little bullheads they look just like catfish
yep
yeah
they do
that 's what i mean cause i am from iowa
oh
we use to catch those little bullheads
that 's
they look just like baby catfish
yeah
did you get to go fishing very often
yeah
i like to fish
the only problem is i just moved to texas
it 's been a little over a year now i am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here
uh-huh
i really i have n't gone fishing for about two years now
uh-huh
it 's driving me crazy
one of these days i will go over to lake lewisville or lake ray hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while
uh-huh
you like to eat them after you catch them
yeah
sure
there 's are a lot of people that like to go fishing
mo-
yeah
most of the time if we catch something we 'll take it home and eat it
you 're right
i like to fish for trout
they are really good fighters
if i went to a restaurant that probably would n't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu
yeah
i know
yeah
do you just skin your catfish
do you fillet them out
how do you
we skin them
do you
yeah
okay
yeah
yeah
just cut their heads off and skin them
i just flour them salt and pepper them and cook them
yeah
i do n't put that corn meal on them
no
that 's the way my mother taught me to fry them
that 's how we do it too
although we use to set some trout lines out
we 've caught fourteen fifteen pound catfish
sometimes those are good to do on a barbecue grill and just leave the skin on and do it with butter on on tin foil
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
the skin just basically scrapes right off
wer-
it really tastes pretty good
yeah
i do n't think i 've ever tried cooking those catfish quite that big
there
most of them are just the small pan frying ones
yeah
i am hoping one of these days i 'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on a rod and reel so far it 's just been on the trout lines
would n't that be something
yeah
yeah
up in south dakota in the missouri river there we 've tied into a few northern pike
they really
in
when the water is cold they are very slow moving fish
in the summer time they 'll give you a run for your money
uh-huh
when you were
when you did go fishing where did you go
you moved there from where
nebraska
uh-huh
yeah in nebraska
it was just like the rivers and the lakes i suppose
yeah
yeah
most of the time we just fished in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in
uh-huh
uh-huh
a lot of them ended up being close to the river
if the river every flooded then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits
uh-huh
we would do a lot of fishing there too
south dakota did n't really have much for
okay
you want to start by telling me what camping is to you
do you backpack or hike
a little bit
nothing overly strenuous
no
the majority of my camping experience is a tent by the lake type situation or maybe a canoe trip or something like that
no
i 've never done a canoe trip
that sounds interesting
it 's
we 've had a lot of fun
i moved to dallas about five years ago
we 've made three different trips since i 've been here of varying degrees of difficulty
the last one we did was a canoe trip in arkansas
the river it was up about three feet
it was pre- it was pretty challenging
i imagine
we
as far as the camping part of that we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and find a clearing in the woods and go for it
they 'll fit in the canoe
you go for days at a time
yeah
yeah
it 's the
that particular one was a two day trip
what
there 's a outfitter
they haul you up to the headwaters come down about halfway and then you spend the night
the second day head on down to the pool at the end of the river
that sounds like fun
yeah
it really is
the camping i grew up with was like tents and coleman stove type
that just out in the woods
i grew up water skiing
i was from california
okay
we would go up to the sacramento river sloughs the delta there
okay
you just pick a campground on the river
right
right
cooled off
when i got married my husband had always backpacked
okay
we did that
i guess we have n't done it since my kids were born about three years ago
that was a new experience for me
i enjoyed it
i like being able to go back into the mountains or where the trail did n't necessarily lead and where you could n't necessarily pitch a tent
i bet
yeah
uh-huh
that was interesting
i have always wanted to do some white water rafting
your canoeing kind of made me think of that
yeah
that was that 's always been our next step
our little group of friends here we 've been kind of getting married off and what not
do n't let that stop you
yeah
that
it just puts a damper on things for a little while
i know
we 're starting to get everybody back together
yeah
we 'd like to do a float trip down like big bend area or something like that
yeah
you have n't done that before
no
no
we have n't made that trip yet
my parents were sailing this last year down off costa rica
they took about two weeks and went into
i do n't even know the name of the river there
they went white water rafting
mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience
she said it was truly incredible
i 'll bet
yeah
i
there 's that sense of it you 're kind of scared that risk of what could happen and then the thrill of the excitement of doing it
uh-huh
yeah
exactly
do you have anything planned for this summer
not really just yet
we 've
i do have a little bit of property
i grew up in south dakota
okay
i 've got a piece of property in minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet
there 's a little lake up there
a group of friends that i went to college with got together
we basically own all the land around this little lake there
it 's divided up into ten lots
i imagine
we 've got a private lake
it 's completely undeveloped at this point
that 's a possibility
the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime
it 's it 's about two hours north of minneapolis
that sounds good
yeah
in fact
i got married last summer
that 's
we ended up there for a couple days on our honeymoon
we kind of took a tour of the united states for about a week and up through that area
that sounds
my wife 's real excited about it
we 're going to hope to get up there sometime early eno-
last year it was the end of july
it was a little too late for the fish
hopefully get up there early enough to get into some of the fish and the the good weather and what not
we 've been wanting to start camping again this year too
my oldest child is a girl was born three years ago three and a half
uh-huh
i have a little one that just turned two
we are in the process of potty training
i did n't want to go camping with diapers
gosh
yeah
yeah
i
at a time when they 're afraid of their shadow all they need is some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent
they 'd be awake all night
that 's right
i think with him almost potty trained and she 's not afraid of her shadow anymore i 'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we 'll be able to go this summer even if it 's like over to rio dosa for a couple of days or something to get them used to it and get them started with little back packs of their own and things like that
sure
right
you bet
yeah
we 'll that
there 's a lot of places with nature trails things like that where they could learn a lot too
uh-huh
that 's true
it 's like this is this is what a pheasant looks like
now we 'll go look for one
i would need that before i could teach them
yeah
that 's
everybody might learn something that way
yeah
that 's
there 's an awful lot of things set up just anything you want to do
like you say it can be a water ski trip or fishing trip or just a sightseeing bird watching hunt with a camera type of thing
there 's a lot of different opportunities for things like that
it 's a lot of fun
it really is
hello
jan how do they recycle in texas
i
the biggest way it 's going right now } most of the grocery stores have got things set up where you can bring in your plastic and your cans and newspapers
uh-huh
they 've just got different barrels setting out
or whatever they 're called gondolas
uh-huh
yeah
yeah is it all voluntary
they 've got them set outside
yes
it 's all voluntary
they do have some places where you can take things and get cash
right
uh-huh
they just want to help recycle which is what we do
yeah
uh-huh
we
probably the only thing sometimes we 'll take the cans in
we let the kids get the money for that
right
yeah
there 's a lot of projects where the boy scouts and things that will collect your cans
f-
right
right
yeah
that 's true
that 's really the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating
uh-huh
i guess i
i guess it depends on your landfill space
uh-huh really
i know i
we 're in maryland
my
i from pennsylvania * [ [ missing copula
my parents are forced recycling
yeah
wow
pennsylvania ohio and new york are some of the
they 're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones
yeah
it 's really hard on them
up here in maryland though we 're just in a voluntary recycling stage right now
my wife and i we save our bottles
we save our newspapers
we save all our plastic and all of our tin cans
just like you say we go to a community area where they have it set up
we dump them off there
it 's vol-
yeah
it 's still voluntary though i think we 're supposed to have something implemented by nineteen ninety-three though where some aspects will be mandatory
you say it is all voluntary
do they
will it be mandatory
uh-huh
is it all
is there any place at all where you do get cash for this stuff
is it all
mostly just the cans
okay
i
yeah
that 's
most of the time like i said that 's a sort of fund raiser things that the schools do or that the boy scouts do or whatever
right
right
yeah
yeah
that 's true
that 's
cans are the only thing i think you really get money for
they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers and stuff like that
uh-huh
i think a lot of people like i said are more concerned with right now the aspects of saving the earth
right
uh-huh
yeah
i think that 's mostly
we
even before
as soon as the community said we 're going to put up bins for recycling we automatically started doing it it 's one of those things
right
just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be separated
uh-huh
that 's
i tell you it 's kind of funny now even at t i i do n't
do you work for t i
no
huh-uh
okay
at t i they 're doing recycling
for a long time they did n't do this
now they 're recycling cans and paper
we have separate bins separate wastebaskets in our offices for paper
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
they
it 's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees it 's really
right
i ca n't believe that because they 've got it all posted all over the place how much they 're saving and how w-
yeah
how well they 're doing
yeah
we do
i i work in a speech interface lab at a at a college
okay
we do basically the same thing
the state of maryland has asked all the colleges and universities and some of the large organizations if they would definitely recycle their office paper
uh-huh
uh-huh
in the giant bins around
it 's surprising how much you never realize because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage can every night
yeah
right
yep
you do n't notice until you start leaving
they do n't pick up your recycling until it 's full you just ca n't believe how much paper that you
right
i know
reams of paper come out of an office every day to recycle
you think about the waste even
uh-huh
cost wise and saving trees and stuff like that
right
it 's just amazing the difference
yeah
i think hopefully if
i guess a lot of the large organizations probably t i did they advertise on television how successful they are
n-
i have n't seen anything
yeah
that does n't mean that they do n't
i do n't watch much t v
yeah
i have n't really seen anything advertise publicly
uh-huh
and like i said they do a lot of internal advertising on that kind of stuff
internal
uh-huh
i have n't seen anything
yeah
i do n't see a lot of t i advertisements on t v anyway
i think they advertise more other places where they 're not located i do n't see a lot of advertisements for t i
right
yeah
that would probably be true
yeah
i know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television
they 'll come up and say
they 'll show you to encourage recycling
they 'll say
right
here those of us that power which is our power company that
uh-huh
we now recycle forty-five percent of our solid waste
right
they
that
we do this for the community
they put those on
i think we 're probably reaching a successful stage and just with voluntary i think
right
even in the kid 's schools they do things to try and recycle
uh-huh
i know my kids if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say look at that somebody is not saving the earth
right
yeah
the kids they really try to educate all ages
it 's good to start the kids real young on
i think so too
yeah
it 's like nobody was concerned about it
right
yeah
we were n't concerned
it 's like
yeah
that 's true
it 's like all of a sudden when there 's noticeable things saying we 're ruining the earth
huh
now everybody is doing something about which is good
uh-huh
how come we were n't doing this twenty years ago
yeah
i think really probably what hit peoples i know that here up in the the new englands area and also in pennsylvania ohio and new york all of a sudden we 're out of landfill
uh-huh
they 're saying we estimate this landfill be ov- will be full in two years unless we cut back
uh-huh
i think that that became
that all of a sudden really hit home that there 's no longer landfill space in some of the more crowded states
this is
what
no other state
i 'm sure texas probably still has some landfill space
they 're not going to voluntarily say ship your garbage here
right
yeah
that 's true
it 's really tough
i think that it really surprises me because of the cost savings
this is such a tremendous amount of cost savings
uh-huh
why
i ca n't understand why nobody saw that before
i even not + even the aspects of not saving the earth
uh-huh
{ e i mean } it 's so cost
right
yeah
in some ways i guess it does n't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it because i know that in pennsylvania they require them to put their newspaper for recycling
the de-inking process that they use to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused is very expensive
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
also it produces a waste a liquid waste that they do n't know what to do with yet they still have cost efficient yet
oh i see
okay
is not real cost efficient
okay
okay
yeah others like tin cans and plastics are really efficient they melt on quickly just because of the heating and things glass
i understand that though
uh-huh
right
and glass
right
yeah
uh-huh
i-
it really is surprising that people have n't noticed it before
yeah
that 's true
uh-huh
yeah
even
i noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil
uh-huh
that kind of surprises me
because once oil gets so thick and yucky you 'd wonder how they could clean that up enough to use it again
yeah
they can
uh-huh
i do n't know how cost efficient that would be i guess
yeah
i do n't know either
that 's
i know that though all those petroleum products though are so terrible for the water table
uh-huh
they really pollute quickly
one
uh-huh
wow
it 's one of those things that they really
yeah
yeah
i know
yeah
how terrible that is
we 'll have to keep our eyes on all that i guess
really
uh-huh
i know i really
i do n't know
i think that i think that they really are doing a good thing now
i hope it keeps
i 'm sure we 'll keep up
yeah
i agree
i think it 's really catching on
uh-huh
i think that
i 'm not sure if it
i do n't know
i think it 's a good idea to make it mandatory
i do too
it
because we were asking some people that live in north dakota are you recycling
they said we 're not forced to do it yet
no
uh-huh
i do n't know
i think that if the people are not forced to do it they may not { d you know }
yeah
i do n't know
i think a lot of people still will
i know that it 's really funny
my parents are forced to do it
they
okay
do you have any favorite teams
i kind of like them all
i played for about eighteen years all the way through college and then kind of hung them up after college
i was going to say you played pro ball
right
no
not quite
not quite
made it
yeah
made it all the way through four years of college playing ball
oh
yes
i 'm a met
i 'm one of these people who 's actually a die hard mets fan and an avid yankee hater
i think it 's one or the other is n't it
yeah
it 's
i i find it very strange
more people
real met fans do n't like the yankees
real yankee fans do n't like the mets for some reason
yeah
i never quite found a new york fan
i always found a fan of one the other
that of course means that when it comes to the american league my favorite team is the red sox by default because i went to college also in boston
okay
i see
yeah
i like the
i guess if i had to pick a favorite team any more as well as
i kind of grew up rooting for philadelphia
oh
i 'm from new jersey originally
yeah
that 's sort of close enough
yeah
we were thirty miles south of them
you were pretty close
right down the river
what are the mets going to do this year without strawberry
i do n't know there 's a part of me that says that i 'm sort of glad strawberry went away
when he sort of went away i started thinking he was performing fairly well
he really was n't worth the baggage
yeah
i think they 're okay
i think they 're
i think they have enough people who are who are still in their prime
uh-huh
certainly if you look at them compared to let 's say eight years ago or something they 're they 're they 're they 're sort of in good standing whereas i certainly do n't think they 're the eighty-six team any more
yeah
i was going to talk to you about that eighty-six team
yeah
i
that was the year they beat houston in extra innings
right
right
they beat houston in extra innings
they won the series bye-bye sort of a sneaky route against boston when there was the ball that was sort of hit to buckner
yeah
i felt real bad about that
what can you do
the guy 's making millions
he ought to be able to perform
right
that 's right
he he was supposedly
there was something wrong with him at the time
i
his knees were bothering him
yeah
right
i understand that
i say if the guy ca n't play you do n't blame that
hit it to him
you blame the team for putting him in
yeah
for having him out there
that 's right
sure
i i was i was also i was in school at boston at the time
boy
i
it was actually wonderful because where i was they were half met fans and half sox fans
yeah
i think we were all pretty much astros fans in the national league championship series
oh
there 's two fellows from brooklyn
they were they were pretty much without having to say they were pretty much mets fans
yeah
yeah
i guess they must have been scared after the
no
not really
they were pretty much thugs
they were n't scared very much
that 's good
they 're brooklyn boys i guess
yeah
you do n't expect them to be much of anything but thugs
really
yeah
i was i was also born in brooklyn
i can call myself a brooklyn thug although i 'm really not
okay
okay
i 'm not to say that all folks from brooklyn are thugs
these two were definitely thugs
they were from brooklyn
i 'm kind of hoping
i i guess any more
i pretty much pull for the rangers though
they 're they 're they they have i think they have the best facilities in the major leagues
yeah
i love going to watch a game in arlington stadium
it 's great
that 's
i think i make something because i think
in as much as sort of fan support helps
yeah
it 's good to have
the only problem is it 's not large enough
it only holds about
i think they when ryan struck out his five thousandth player they squeezed about forty thousand people in there
yes
it is kind of small
yeah
they they have plans
the owner tried to move them to florida
right
they ended up sticking around in arlington
they 're going to build a new stadium in arlington as a matter of fact not even in dallas
that 's great
that 's something that we 're looking forward to
yeah
that 'll be nice
that i think tends to keep
i think stadiums work tend to keep people happy
case in point toronto
yeah
exactly
yeah
have you seen a game up there
i have n't been to any toronto games yet
boy i saw it i was up there on business last june and watched a game in the sky dome
it was just phenomenal
that 's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums i think
of stadiums yeah
to get up there
the best i 've been up here so far in up state new york is is rochester red wings game
uh-huh
is rochester
where is cornell university
cornell is in ithaca
ithaca
yeah
cornell is about somewhere about two and a half hours south and east of us
okay
if you know where lake ontario is sort of
yeah
rochester is right on the shores is n't it
yeah
we 're about ten miles south of lake ontario
yeah
okay
whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion because they built it far enough from the city that it actually could n't be a port city
they
they say that from that space needle up in toronto you can see the lights of rochester on a clear night
i had n't actually known that
yeah
we have our own triple a team here
yeah
the redwings they 're a farm team for the orioles
yeah
okay
yeah
everybody hopes that they go all the way around here
there 's the
they 're the big team in rochester
those games are fun to watch
you you watch those games
yeah
i
we we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they 're fun
yeah
lots of really big
lots of local fans small stadium
they 'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes
uh-huh
uh-huh
especially
i 'll make a day game or something
yeah
they really seem to
people really get into it
i again i ca n't make any predictions about them
yeah
we used to like watching
my folks lived down in beaumont
on the campus of lamar university they used to house the beaumont golden gators who were a double a team for the padres i think
they were fun games to watch
those are i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes
someti-
there 's definitely a lot more hitting
yes
it 's true
one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are
yeah
i guess when you start pitching real well move them up
yeah
yeah
as far as the major league teams i do n't know the rangers have been
every year they always knock on the door early and then just go into their skid about the end of june
they 've got so much young raw talent
it 's just amazing
they just have n't been able to put anything together
the way i see it is
i can use a met analogy here
uh-huh
if you 'll think back a few years to when the mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but were n't very sort of well trained
yeah
back to maybe eighty eighty-four or eighty-three or eighty-five when they were n't quite the eighty-six team that that they were
uh-huh
right
i
that probably gives the readers a good shot for you this year or next year if i think the young talent really just has to build itself up
yeah
they 've been young for a while
they 're almost starting to age a little bit here
i just
yeah
yeah
they really hurting pitching wise
they 've got ryan
who knows what he 'll be able to do
he 's been
last year he started having some nagging injuries it 'll be interesting to watch
right
i hope to get up there
we usually try to get to opening day game
there 's several guys from our church try to go up there
that must be nice
yeah
i guess we 're maybe a hundred fifty miles south of dallas
no
not too bad
it takes about two hours two and a half hours to get there
yeah
it takes me a good seven hours to get to shay stadium
i do n't know
that 's probably because of the roads
you just do n't have
we 've just got a freeway
we just get right on the freeway and just go north
yeah
we can i can take a highway the whole way down
it 's some + it 's it 's almost four hundred hou-
it 's so crowded up there
it 's almost four hundred
barring traffic it 's four hundred hours
four hundred mil-
four hundred hours
right
four hundred miles barring traffic
golly
it 's it 's it 's a heck of a drive
we are substantially north of new york enough that we do n't get to go play too often
yeah
you 're like a boat ride from
how far is it across the lake to canada
toronto
toronto
toronto 's only about two hours
yeah
yeah
toronto i want to go see
do you drive there
do you take the ferry or what
i can
i 've driven
i 've heard about the ferry as well
yeah
have n't taken it yet though
have you taken it
yeah
it 's a beautiful city
yeah
i really love
i think that 's one of the most enjoyable things about being up here
i 'm only up here for school
uh-huh
you go back to new york after school
no
probably south maybe texas
really
some place south and warm
i do n't
i 'm not a big cold fan
what kind of weather are you having right now
right now we 're actually having
it 's getting nice
it was in the high fifties today
three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm
boy
yeah
we 've been up in the seventies eighties even up in the nineties a couple of weeks ago
that 's great
about that same time branches were falling off everywhere
we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks
golly
because of the ice
it did n't make the national news too much which i find really weird
we were
all schools were closed for over for a week
golly
there were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive
illegal
yeah
they had so many power lines down
yeah
many things like that
they were
all right
okay
what do you think of the giants
i like the giants
they got
i probably did n't get into baseball until maybe three years ago really
yeah
i just like the giants
i do n't know why
i really got into them
i read dave dreveki 's book his autobiography
yeah
yeah
was n't that something of him
yeah
that was incredible
yeah
that 's really a
really proud of him though the way he 's
the way he handled that entire situation there
yeah
really
i just think the giants have a good team
they got all
they 're they 're real balanced out
they got real good pitching
they got the hitting to go along with it
yeah
i just do n't understand why they 're not right up there on the top
yeah they need that i think they just need that one element to push them over the top
i do n't really know what it is
every team that 's really good seems
like the as they had they just had it all that one year
yeah
i was mostly an as fan
i had been to more games at the as than i have in the giants because i lived in oakland for some time
yeah
yeah
i still like the giants though
yeah
if you 're a fan you got to stay with the team any way good and the bad
yeah
right
it 's kind of hard
i still basically the
me and all my friends around here since we do n't have anywhere
we can go to the astros or the rangers teams
since no-
of me and my friends are really like either one of those teams
we
uh-huh
about the most baseball we get is t v we play it on nintendo
we play r b i baseball on nintendo that 's small town trying to make it through not being around it really
yeah
right
right
yeah
yeah
right
i prefer football over baseball
yeah
yeah
so do i
baseball is still
it 's
you got to do something when football ai n't on
hot dogs baseball and apple pie
yeah
exactly
this is america
yeah
what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams
i do n't know it 's hard to say
i have n't really
you have to just keep up with everything in the off- season
it 's kind of hard to do
at least you have to read the paper and sports illustrated and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and all that
i know
like i say if they can get that one element that they were missing i think the giants can do it
yeah
the giants are
they just
i do n't
yeah
i do n't really know about the as
they kind of
yeah
makes you sick does n't it
yeah
you hear what you hear what he did
yes
he ramming his wife 's car
i was like yeah
he 's like a little bitty kid
yeah
he 's just a a little boy with a lot of money
yeah
that 's just
yeah
i guess the giants might move away from san francisco it sounds like
yeah
i 've heard talk about that
they wo n't be that far away
san francisco will be hurting anyhow
yeah
they 're not going to be happy about it
i hope they can do good
that 's just
i think they 're a good team that just need that one little thing to push them over
i do n't know exactly what it is
they got
they 're pretty balanced out all the way through
it just might be the drive more than anything else
uh-huh
they probably just need something to push them because that 's the only thing i can see that 's holding them back is the ambition to do it
uh-huh
uh-huh
somebody basically
maybe they just need everybody to tell them they ca n't do it
maybe that 's what some teams need
look at the twins going from worst to first
i know is n't that something
yeah my roommate 's a twins fan for forever
i could n't believe that
he had his year this year
yeah
i just it
we got into that a whole bunch
uh-huh
uh-huh
that was a series to remember for sure
uh-huh
i saw all seven games of that
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i could n't believe that
yeah
i do n't
there was braves in that chanting that they had
that would drive you up a wall
yeah
they
every team with the indians been doing that now
i ca n't figure out why
you have to figure out why they 're all doing that i 'm like it 's does n't work it 's obvious it does n't work because the braves did n't win
yeah
you 're right
why keep on doing something that did n't work i do n't know
yeah
yeah
yeah
i was kind of surprised that we were going to talk about baseball
i get a woman 's voice i was i was thinking uh-huh
i talked to a guy named vinny last night about fixing your car
really
yeah
i got a call the other night about fixing your automobile up
uh-huh
uh-huh
baseball 's baseball
yeah
right
it 's kind of
i do n't know it 's kind of odd they pick
do you pick the topic or does the computer
no
they give you a list of things that you want
steve this is
like i mentioned brian and i guess we 're going to want to be talking about child care
do you have any experience in finding child care
ourselves we have i guess never had to look for child care
uh-huh
our kids are now fourteen and eighteen
you go back those many years and we did n't do it very much
uh-huh
i guess we were in a situation where we did n't need to be looking at two family income at the time
uh-huh
our kids were older
i 've had to deal with friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing
right
it
my involvement has n't been direct
still have been certainly exposed to criteria people are using
uh-huh
how about yourself
we 're kind of lucky
i 'm i 'm working
my wife is n't working
she is taking care of the kids also
we have n't had to look for child care either which has been very nice
i do have like you mentioned a lot of friends a lot of co-workers and associates that are looking for child care
some of the things that they 're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care what kind of guidance counselor to student or adult to child relationship
how many
right
you do n't want to have thirty or forty kids and only one adult
then something happens and the adult would n't be able to accommodate or take care of the kids very well
right
they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time
depends also upon the level of the child
we we take a very close look at finding a preschool a good preschool for our kid
uh-huh
i kind of relate that to that in making sure that the teachers are very well educated themselves they have a good curriculum and that they 're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them
it 's very important i feel that the kids interact with other children also
it 's a good way to develop relationships with other kids their age and get to know and work with kids
yeah
i do n't know i guess we 're kind of in the same boat
we have n't had to look very carefully for child care
yeah
i kind of think that some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care
uh-huh
even here i guess we have in one sense two forms of child care
there 's where individuals will in one primarily babysit children in their own home
uh-huh
that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to maybe seven or eight children
uh-huh
otherwise there will be
the majority are co-operative day-cares
people form a co-op and parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours
frequently they will hire staff to be at the day-care
the emphasis is primarily someplace for the children to be
uh-huh
at the same time there 's some fairly good training programs and some of them formal two year programs
right
right
that
there is some definite creative play good social interaction that kind of thing
i think it 's important like you mentioned that 's a good idea on the parent co-op because i 'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids
i do n't want to just take them to somebody i pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere
i want to trust the people
yeah
you hear on the t v and you read the newspaper quite often of people that do n't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of
hope to never get into that situation where we have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children
hope that we can stay in this situation for awhile
yeah
we 've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here
uh-huh
i guess it are
it 's typically whether it 's been child care in a home or in a larger situation where actually it 's more of an institution
uh-huh
you 've actually got children that most people would consider problem children
it 's more of a group home rather than actually day-care type of facility
yeah
that 's true
that 's true
steven it 's been
okay
i do n't have any i guess definite views about elderly care
the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see where elderly people are abused and things like that
uh-huh
yeah
i think that 's one thing that i would look at if i was putting my grandmother or my mother in some sort of home
right
yeah
yeah
i agree with you
i
a group that i 'm a part of goes once a month to they call it the heritage house
uh-huh
it 's a nursing home for elderly people
uh-huh
this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape
uh-huh
uh-huh
i watched
the interesting thing was i watched this particular one change hands
it started out just being a terrible place for the people
uh-huh
a new company bought it and came in and remodeled the whole place
uh-huh
uh-huh
hired new nurses and just redid it
just out of curiosity what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place
to me it was dirty for one thing
uh-huh
when you would walk in the smell was just awful
uh-huh
the floors if you 're walking on them feel how filthy they were
uh-huh
uh-huh
there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and crying
my goodness
of course i do n't know how many of them were not in their right mind or how many were
uh-huh
in pain or something
yeah
yeah
i just really do n't know
i feel like they were neglected
uh-huh
yeah
that was what i was going to say
it sounds like just neglect all over
right
neglect to cleanup
right
i do n't really think anyone was being cruel or trying to mistreat them or anything
uh-huh
i just think they were not doing anymore than they had to do
just kind of letting everybody live in a not very good environment
uh-huh
this new company came in
like i said they remodeled the place
uh-huh
it smells nice when you walk in
it looks nice
they got several new color t v 's for the people and redid the dining room where they made it a lot more place for them to be
uh-huh
uh-huh
they made a little patio area where they can go outside
that 's great
yeah
just small things that make it seem a lot more homey
yeah
yeah
it 's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just
i would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or anyone is in a home like that
my biggest fear that they would be is that they would be lonely
right
i would like to know that there are just a lot of activities like you said just putting a plant in a room just brightens and + and [ just makes them just a little more active
right
right
television
uh-huh
they can go outside
just to know that they 're not laying in a room looking at gray walls that 's what would just really kill me
right
exactly
yeah
i 'd like to know that they have friends there
right
and they have little conversations and things
right
i 'd like to know there 's a lot of interaction and maybe some kind of activity little field trips or something
yeah
yeah
i do n't know how they would do that
they
this place that we visit it 's really neat
everyday they have schedules of groups that come in
uh-huh
they will do bingo
our group does a church service once a month
uh-huh
other groups come in and do the services other sundays
uh-huh
that they have at least one service every sunday
uh-huh
there are a lot of things
there are places that have a lot of things for them to do
you really do have to kind of seek it out and make sure that it 's not a place like this one was
uh-huh
i did n't realize that there were groups that go in like that
that 's really neat
yeah
yeah
yeah
it is
it 's real nice
i know our church does it
there are a lot of other churches
they are just like civic organizations that do
right
uh-huh
i have other friends
it 's kinds of neat they take animals over and let the people pet them
oh
they also have a dog that maybe needs a home
they will wash it all up and make sure it 's a friendly animal and take it in and just let the old elderly people pet the dogs
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's great
yeah
that will be something they would look forward to if they knew that the puppy is coming on wednesday
yeah
that would be something to look for
that 's really neat
yeah
yeah
that really is
i thought that was a real unusual thing for someone to do
uh-huh
yeah
there 's a lot that can be done
uh-huh
it 's just a matter of people not being lazy
right
doing the best they can
again i do n't know what i 'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother
yeah
putting any of my family in an elderly home to me would be the very last resort
right
it
i know it 's hard for a lot of families if you 're trying to work or trying to take care of your own family it 's kind of hard to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent on you
right
uh-huh
i know that 's hard sometimes it would really have to be a last resort because that would just
yeah
yeah
i would feel so guilty
yeah
yeah
i would too
i do n't know
yeah
right
yeah
i know
i know what you mean
i do n't know anyone personally that 's in an elderly home
yeah
i have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because many of them of course their minds are not good
uh-huh
a lot them have told me exactly the same story and tell me something that they did
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
the next time i go it 's the same thing just somebody to listen to them
uh-huh
yeah
just seems to make them really feel good
nod your head and smile at them
right
i 'll tell you the people i feel the sorriest for
there 's a guy at this particular one i go to that i think that he 's really an intelligent person
uh-huh
uh-huh
he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just can not communicate
uh-huh
he 's blind
he has seizures
uh-huh
he 's just in a world of his own
yet he wants so much to be around people
right
if you come over to him if he can touch your hand he 'll grab it and kiss it
oh
he 's always got a smile
he really tries to brighten up your life
it 's just amazing
oh
he ca n't say anything
he can just kind of make noises
that 's something that if i had to work in an elderly home i do n't think i could do it
yeah
i would really like to be a teacher
yeah
i do n't think i could do it because i 'm very very emotional
me too
the minute something happens
yeah
i cry on hallmark commercials
i know
that 's just the end of me
i know
i mean something real life i just
uh-huh
i interview a lot of children
i 'm an education reporter
uh-huh
i always go and do an education things
uh-huh
i meet these kids who are dropping out of school left and right
yeah
all the sudden they 're in this program
they 're making straight a 's
they 're going to graduate early
uh-huh
i just want to hug them and go you are just fantastic
yeah
yeah
i could just imagine working in a home like that
yeah
those people they 're so sweet and so genuine
uh-huh
uh-huh
all they want is just for everything to be happy
yeah
yeah
it does
yeah
yeah
it is
it 's really hard one of the neatest things i think though is we always take our kids
uh-huh
i have a three year old and a six year old
uh-huh
they have gotten comfortable being around these people because they 've always gone with us
uh-huh
uh-huh
the people love them
i 'm sure
they want the children to hug them or hold their hand
so far my kids will do it just real easily
uh-huh
i think it 's because they 've gone since they were real little
yeah
they 've never been afraid
that 's something
to me children need to
uh-huh
people need to take groups of children because the kids just brighten up their lives
right
yeah
as we walk through the lobby they 'll all say bring her here
i want to see her
i would love to hold her
children
usually a of elderly people they like to share their experiences with the younger children
uh-huh
they 'll be telling them all kinds of stories that they do n't even know what they mean
yeah
that 's true
they feel like they 've lived life
they need to share it
yeah
i 'm sure i 'll be like that too
me too
yeah
yeah
it 's quite an experience
that 's great
i did n't know there were such groups
yeah
yeah
there are
it really helps those people i think
uh-huh
like you said i 'd really have a lot of second thoughts before i put any of my own family members there
yeah
yeah
it would be a last resort
i would hate it if anyone put me in one
i know
i 'm always afraid like
no
what if i lose my mind
yeah
am i going to end up in a place like that
somebody take care of me
yeah
that 's right
okay
okay
nice to talk to you
yeah
you too
thanks for calling
uh-huh
bye-bye
bye
okay
let 's start with you
okay
the last movie i saw was the five heartbeats
i liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it
five heartbeats
yeah it 's it 's robert townsend movie
who was in that
okay
i do n't know all the actors or anything
it was a lot of music a lot of old songs things like that
when was it out
it 's still out now
it came out i guess about a month or about a month and half ago something like that
it 's about a black singing group
it
it was called the dells
uh-huh
it was kind of like just about their life and their history and things like that and from how they went from stardom to nonstardom
yeah
that was pretty good
i enjoyed
i saw dances with wolves
have you seen that
yeah
i saw that one
that was pretty good
yeah
yeah
that won best picture i think
uh-huh
costner got best director
yeah
right now kevin costner he 's starring in everything
he 's doing the kennedy movie that 's coming out
there 's one
another kennedy movie
yeah
yeah
starring kevin costner
let me see
what else
he 's doing some other movie
i ca n't
i think robin hood that 's it
the robin hood coming out
he 's going to be in also
let me see
what else have i seen
what have you seen
one comes to mind here
i not sure about the name has meryl streep
what was the name of that
the ba-
the premise of the story is that after you die you go to a place called judgment city
i know what you 're talking about
my
i ca n't remem-
the other actor
it 's called reviewing my life or something like that
yeah
yeah
i did n't get to see that
defending your life
yeah
that 's it
okay
defending your life
it 's an excellent movie
uh-huh
it 's pretty entertaining
let 's see
what else have i seen lately
one of my favorite movies it 's not one that i have n't seen
i w-
it 's not a late movie fatal attraction
home alone
okay
yeah
it 's probably my all time
not all time favorite
one of my favorites that i can watch over and over
ye-
di-
did you ever see home alone
no
i never did
i heard it was really good
i 've just have n't gone out to see it
that was a good one too
was that pretty funny
yeah
it 's pretty good
yeah
yeah
somehow just never made it to see that
i need to see it
i ca n't believe i 'm just drawing a blank because i 've s-
yeah
fatal attraction i do n't know why i like that movie so much
i guess it was so much suspense
uh-huh
i like suspense
that kind of reminds me
did you ever see this is going way back jagged edge
yes
uh-huh
yeah
on that order
that was a good one too
yeah
certainly is
i liked the woman that played in that
i forgot what her name is now
yeah
that 's
anne archer she was the wife in fatal attraction
yeah
okay
she played in narrow margin which was a little more recent
uh-huh
that was kind of another suspense type alfred hitchcock type thriller
yeah
that was good
god i guess i have n't seen too many movies lately
i need to
i have n't seen a whole lot either
yeah
uh-huh
somehow
it 's hard for me to get to movies now because it 's getting so expensive
i 'd rather rent
i know
it 's obnoxious because you go in there and you spend six bucks a ticket
yeah
then you end up spending another six dollars on food
yeah
that 's just for a bucket of popcorn
a pop
it gets pretty
yeah
yeah
god forbid you should want something to drink with it
yeah
if i
if i take a date it cost me twenty bucks easy
uh-huh
yeah
easily
i do n't know
you 're usually going to go to dinner or something with that
i was going to say you can find certain restaurants that are nice and have good food eat for thirty dollars
yeah
it 's almost more fun
yeah
it 's almost more fun really to rent movies just kind of stay at home maybe
yeah
the problem is you always have to wait until they 're out
yeah
that 's true too
that 's what you 're dealing with
yeah
then you can make your popcorn and be comfortable
that 's true
that is true
uh-huh
that 's about all the movies i 've seen recently
i ought to open the paper here because i know i 've seen a few that have played
i just ca n't come up with any names here
uh-huh
[ have n't have n't been to one for a little while
did you ever see kindergarten cop
no
i never did
that was pretty good
was that arnold schwarzenegger
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
there 's a movie i do want to see
i have n't seen it
what is it
oka-
kiss before dying
yeah
whose in that
it looks pretty suspenseful
uh-huh
another one i saw is called the object of beauty
i do n't recommend that as much as defending your life
it was all right kind of funny
what else has been on and about
are you looking in the paper
yeah
oh
i 'm trying to
i wanted to get to the silence of the lambs
i hear that
yeah
that was great
did you see that
yes
that that might be one of my all time favorites too
that was an excellent movie
it was pretty scary because i was visiting a v a hospital near to where i live
they were saying that some of the patients there you ca n't leave by themselves because they 'll make a weapon out of anything
out of a piece of paper they can kill somebody
uh-huh
this guy in silence of the lambs hannibal lector he was that kind of person
you
they could n't leave him alone
uh-huh
it was really fas-
he was very dangerous
you were kind of on his side because he was so fascinating
huh
they could n't leave him alone at all
they found out what happened when they did leave him alone one time
i wo n't tell you that just in case you see the movie
yeah
i 'll probably try to see it in a little while here
uh-huh
very good
it 's been out for a while
yeah
yeah
i 'm not sure when it will be hitting video stores
it should be a while yet though
have you heard anything on out for justice
i have n't heard anything about it
i
i do n't like steven seagal things
has he had very many other movies out
he 's had out for justice
there was one right before that with a similar title
i do n't know some macho title
that 's why i just do n't like the
because it 's a macho movie
yeah
it is
i do n't like that a lot
i do n't watch a lot of arnold schwarzenegger or anything like that either
speaking of that i think terminator two is supposed to be out
yeah
yeah
that might be good though
that might be good
i do n't know
i 've enjoyed a lot of his movies
uh-huh
they 're action filled and a little bit of humor
uh-huh
uh-huh
i guess i 'm not fond of the action packed movie where they 're always chasing or fighting
yeah
i like the movies that make you think
yeah
did you ever see sleeping with the enemy
no
i have n't seen that yet
that 's something i really should have seen
was that good
did you see it
i have n't heard much lately
uh-huh
i just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews
yeah
a friend of mine saw it
she said it was okay
yeah
it was n't anything spectacular
you expect more out of julia roberts though
yeah
the previews looked so good that i wanted to see it
i never did
did you ever see the original f x movie
yea-
i saw half of it
i remember i was in school i saw half of it
i fell asleep
everyone else watched it
okay
because i was going to say i always enjoyed that
i i remember that movie
uh-huh
uh-huh
it was
i got in to it
yeah
i do n't know if
yeah
yeah
i really need to go see the original one
i 'm sure it was a good movie
i probably had a test that day or something
i do n't know
yeah
it was one of those that has a lot of twists in it
yeah
yeah
it 's it 's it 's
i ca n't put it exactly on the lines of the jagged edge
uh-huh
yeah
you get these twists
it 's usually pretty good
i think though that movies are losing their luster
what 's that
i think movies are losing their attractiveness just to a lot of people
just
i think
i do n't know
because of the cost
i think it 's just losing its originality or something
i do n't
i ca n't pinpoint it
yeah
yeah
it does n't seem like it 's as big rage to get the movie theater as it used to be
that 's probably true
i i
just you see the same story lines different characters
uh-huh
yeah
exactly
it 's it 's hard to say
an
i know i do n't
i do n't keep up with it
right
i do n't try to
ju- just for that reason it does cost a lot
uh-huh
why go out and see something right away
you kind of wait
if something gets really good reviews maybe you 'd finally go spend the twelve bucks to go to it
right
right
uh-huh
i have n't been to an opening for ages just because
uh-huh
thanks for being home on the weekend
i 'm actually working at night
there very few people that are on the list for calls on the weekends nights
uh-huh
yeah
sometimes i 'm home
sometimes i 'm not
if i am it 's always fun to talk
are you part of the school system out there
i am as a matter of fact
i 'm at north carolina state
the reason i said that because i 've had about three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of north carolina
i guess they pass the names amongst your computer students or whatever
yeah
i think i was the one who did that
is that ri-
great
great
yeah
i had a
i teach a course in voice i o systems
is that right
that 's wonderful
i know about this project
i got my students to sign up
apparently a number of them have been participating
yeah
i talked to one
we 're not on the subject of course
i talked to one
i think he had a whole bunch of calls
he had a roommate that had calls and everything
uh-huh
he had way more twice as many calls as as i 've made
i 'm
of course we at t i just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will sell like gang busters
yeah
okay
you first on the subject
what do you think about latin america
let 's see
the subject is latin america
latin america
yeah
i do n't know whether i have any real profound thoughts about that
i was planning a trip to latin america
i got warned off by some people
they say peru ca n't be traveled to
the crime rate in brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth
really
t i had a place
i 'm not too sure
i do n't think they do anymore
down
i think it was campinas
i 'm not sure
i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever
they had quite a few locations
not quite a few several in latin america
i think the one in new mexico is closed
i think the one in brazil is closed
i do n't know why that is a problem down there
i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too
an
some people say go to new york
i do n't have an answer to the crime rate
it 's sad
that is a sad situation
i 'd like to go down to mexico
i keep hearing that the government and the crime rates pretty high too
that is sad not that we can sell any great program we have with crime
yeah
i think i 'm kind of like you
i do n't have any strong opinions on it
i guess maybe that 's our biggest problem we have with our neighbors down there is that we do n't have any
we have more
i guess ties
we in the united states have more ties to europe and everything
we do n't really are n't that close to everyone in south america
i do n't really know why though
yeah
i do n't understand it either although i think a lot of south americans regard the united states as bullying
that 's certainly from a historical point of view would be true
right
certainly we took far more from mexico than saddam hussein ever dreamed of taking in his wildest dreams from his neighbors
right
yeah
i know that i saw in a book
i was reading a spanish book not that i read spanish
i just reading some spanish words
there was a comment in there about the mexicans do n't really want us to say we 're americans
they would like to say that we 're north americans because they 're americans too
i guess that 's true
we do n't think of any one else but oursel-
i guess we 're kind of the smart asses in the world i suppose or of america anyway
we think of ourselves as the only americans when they 're americans too
yeah
i think they 're going to have
that 's a tough row for them to hoe because i think most of the world is going to regard citizens of the united states as americans and citizens of mexico as mexicans
as mexicans
yes
that
they can stand on their heads if they want too
i do n't think that they 're going to change that north americans i think when you say that even i tend to think of americans and canadians
no
no
i know
i just do n't think of mexicans as being north americans although i guess strictly speaking they are
yeah
no
they were saying that of us that we 're the north americans and they 're americans
they
we always say we 're americans
they want us to say we 're the north americans
i see
we 're not americans
we 're north americans
they 're south americans
yeah
i do n't know
whatever
i do n't want to make
i read it somewhere though
it 's not my point i guess
yeah
it 's so interesting i just do n't think mexico 's problems are going to be cured by semantics
no
no
they were lucky enough to have some oil ten years ago
they blew all that and borrowed more money than they can pay back now
they 're not exactly business men
i do think we should deal more with them
i do have a lot of sympathy in that we 're here in texas
for the language is very foolish
i 'm relatively familiar with texas school system
we should teach spanish at least in grammar school four or five grades of it so that we can speak spanish
i think that helps when you certainly can speak their language
there are problems with the wet back problem
for everyone knows what we 're talking about
whe- say wet back problem
we should somehow
i think the governments are working on that to try to have some businesses at the borders of both sides so that you do n't have this problem of them trying to come up here to get the jobs
there there may be some organized way to do this
yeah
i do feel for them
they are very envious of us or they would n't be coming up here risking a lot
not that they 're risking their lives of course but risking a lot
getting thrown back i guess is all that happens
yeah
you probably do n't see that
where
we see it once a month i 'm sure in san antonio they see it more often than that
i grew up in los angeles
okay
you saw it out there then too
in fact i drove a cab when i was a graduate student
i knew the hispanic part of l a pretty well
uh-huh
certainly knew that problem
knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that
yeah
it was pretty wild
i think a common factor to a lot of problems whether it be crime if you want to jump on that is mostly poverty
i think a lot of their problems is poverty
if we could
the problems we have in this country is a lot of it 's poverty
whether it 's the people are n't trying hard enough to get out of poverty that 's another story
it is sad
there 's so much down in all of south america so much potential
we 're
t i of course is really pushing world markets in their products
they 're mostly in europe now and in in the orient japan and singapore now just announced building a plant in singapore
they 're in taiwan and japan
they have n't had that much luck in south america
there 's got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything
yeah
there 's got to be trade
i guess that 's some of the answer i guess is business
i try to be an optimist and say well that 's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to get some business going between each other
we need to do more of that somehow and encourage more business between us
yeah
yeah
they 've got to have a lot of resources i would think an enormous amount of potential that way
a lot of it of course is hot and jungle and all that
there 's got to be a lot of potential down there
yeah
what are you taking in school
i did n't ask you that
what are you taking in school
i am
you 're an instructor
yeah
yeah
you 're an instructor
yeah
you said
yeah
i 'm the teacher
i give as it were
that 's great
are you teaching computer science
wha-
you said what were you saying you were teaching there
yeah
i 'm in computer science
great
great
of course this project is really one to collect a data base of of casual speech in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like
right
of course i work at t i
i 'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time why that is n't enough
i 'm i 'm getting a kick out of the whole program
there 's going to be i guess thousands i do n't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings
i wonder how they 're going to analyze them whether it would be listening to them or analyzing
i gu-
they 've got to be analyzing with a voice recorder some how
yeah
they record these
somebody transcribes them so that they have they have a speech signal
uh-huh
what
what is said
right
they 're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening
that 's a big problem in speech recognition
yes
i know they change with age
i know mine has changed
although you never found
your voice echoes in your own head which makes it different than what it really sounds to other people
yeah
i 'm sure singers and professional people know that
you always hear your own voice in recordings and say that 's obviously that 's not me
yeah
i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way
go ahead
you comment on it
yeah
i 'm glad that you 're in the business
that
i kno-
t is gotten with their speak and spell and everything
i 've told my wife that one of the reasons they 're doing it is because eventually you 'll be able to talk to your computer
right
you would n't have to have a keyboard
you 'll be able to just give it commands
i 'm sure they have some of that now
not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people
okay
what kind of ex-
do you have children
yeah
we have one that 's seventeen one that 's fifteen and one that 's just now six
okay
we had kind of a hard time finding someplace
his birthday is the first of september
uh-huh
he was going to school at five
oh
he started the first grade when he was five
uh-huh
yeah
first grade when he was five years old
you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five
yeah
uh-huh
we could
we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something
right
it was mediocre expensive
it was n't really that expensive
uh-huh
it 's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something
to learn something
that 's
even not only toddlers but your older children
yeah
it 's hard to find anywhere they 're really going to learn something
yeah
yeah
you do have to pay if you
the better the place the more you 're going to pay
yeah
parents pay when they stay home with them anyway
true
very true
it 's
my wife works it costs us more for her to stay home more than it does for him to go to the baby-sitter
uh-huh
we try to
if i had any children i hope that i 'll be in a position to stay home with my child because i 'm not real trusting a lot of people especially today
yeah
i do n't know
people
i work in the news business
i just see different things all the time
yeah
people are just crazy these days
they 're crazy i do n't
yeah
it takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend much less to trust someone with my child
yeah
we took our time
we checked it out
uh-huh
we found a preschool for him
uh-huh
it
through other folks where i work
i work at t i
uh-huh
through other folks where we worked we found a nice preschool
it was actually at a licensed preschool
uh-huh
we had those requirements
uh-huh
i guess that 's the best way to get recommendations from your friends or family members
yeah
i know
i 'm
that
i do n't think i would have left him anywhere that would
i would have stayed home with him first before i left him somewhere that
uh-huh
they still have unlicensed baby-sitters running around up here i i do n't think i 'd take that chance
huh
uh-huh
i think it 's out of sight or out of mind for less than for more than a minute or so
yeah
yeah
you 've got to be sure that these people
not that they 're going to abuse your child or anything you just have to be sure that they 're going to be watching them that they would n't let them drink something or eat something off the floor
you never know
yeah
yeah
just simple things that can be harmful
you as far as child abuse is these days you never know
uh-huh
you do n't know who you can trust and who you ca n't
huh
then you hear so much on the news about child care places
also senior care facilities you hear abuse
yeah
senior care is getting real bad
yeah
you just do n't know
you almost want to spend a couple of weeks in class with your child just to see how it is or something
yeah
you have no children at all
no
i do n't
huh-uh
gee
no
i 'm
do you miss that part in your life
no
i 'm twenty-three still have a little bit of time
yeah
yeah
yeah
it 's just not in the cards for me right now
i 'm trying to get my career going
i imagine
uh-huh
yeah
working in the news production
yeah
back to the subject
yeah
we should have discussed this earlier
it 's tough
uh-huh
it really is
it 's hard to find good child care
uh-huh
it 's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he 's going to be fine all day long
uh-huh
you brought up a good point about learning
you just do n't want a baby-sitter
you would hope that maybe they 'd come home and know some of their a b c 's or something
get them
yeah
he 's doing real well
it it has paid off for him
uh-huh
he 's in first grade now
uh-huh
he 's got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level
huh
those early ages when his mom and dad are at work and he 's actually in child care in a preschool not just child care we could have sent him to anybody
yeah
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
there 's a lot people at work that would have baby-sat him sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something has paid off not only for us
right
his attitude is i think a little bit tall for a six year old
uh-huh
his
did you take this same route with your other two children
they were outside my marriage
okay
uh-huh
i do n't know
uh-huh
i was wondering how
i would say no
all my children excel
uh-huh
they 're really good
uh-huh
i guess no
he learns from the older boys too
right
it helps that he has older brothers just to have role models and things like that
yeah
yeah
yeah
seeing
in one way we 're kind of lucky because they 're all boys
in another way we 're not so lucky because we do n't have another woman in the house for my wife to share
uh-huh
uh-huh
we faced that too
huh
he learned quite a bit not only from nursery school
he learned quite a bit from the older boys
uh-huh
he 's excelled
it 's paying off for him
it really is he is pretty smart
that 's excellent
sometimes he 's a little bit smart mouthed
uh-huh
he is smart
what kid is n't these days
yeah
i think it 's really nice to know that you can find someplace
i do n't know how it is down there in waco
uh-huh
in lubbock we have a few that you can send your children to
they can actually learn something instead of just being baby-sat
do they have any kind of program at t i or wherever your wife works some kind of day care
no
not in
huh-uh
we just
i know they 're putting that into a lot of corporations now
yeah
they 're trying to
the federal government is trying to on that too
right
no
we do n't get
maybe that will be an option for
it would be nice there
then i foresee that being just a baby-sitting thing not much learning but kind of somebody to just watch your kid while your at work
yeah
there 's not
where we sent michael the first few years there was different teachers all the time
huh
some substitute teachers in the afternoon
uh-huh
they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day
right
they had a group of kids
they put on skits
they put on plays
huh
they did the halloween thing and the valentine 's day things
uh-huh
it was important to us
huh
we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way
do you think it would have been better for him to have maybe one continuous teacher somebody that he could get attached to
is it better the other way with a lot of different
no
as a child growing up i think is a task that belongs to his parents
uh-huh
i do n't think he needed to be attached to too even though he did
uh-huh
he attached himself to a couple of those
right
i think his attachments at home
he gets the idea of what school is for
i have different teachers here
huh
this person can teach me one thing and this person teach me another
no
i i really ca n't say that it 's important for him to attach himself to anybody
right
huh
he did well
uh-huh
you
right
yeah
each child is individual learning and things
yeah
i do n't have that experience
i ca n't say that he did well
uh-huh
i do n't think we made too many mistakes
right
it sounds good
we tried hard
sounds like he 's doing real well
yeah
he 's doing real well
huh
good
he learned from it
that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be baby-sat all day
baby-sat sounds to me like you 're here i guess i 'll watch you when i get time
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
maybe i 'll clean my house maybe i 'll cook you lunch maybe i wo n't
uh-huh
they 'll probably sit him in front of the television while they do other things
yeah
yeah
yeah i do n't allow that when he 's at home
we had a good experience
we really did well
that 's good
that 's good
he served better than we did
he actually gained from it
sure we gained from it because we were allowed to continue our employment and continue our family
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think in the long run he gained from it just being somewhere where we learned something instead of just sitting around watching t v and playing all day
that 's great
right
right
it 's important
that 's probably what i 'll try and look for whenever i do have my children
yeah
i do n't know when that will be
yeah
just really look into
it will take me a long time to find somewhere i 'm sure just because i just want to be i want to be so positive that my children are okay as well as the other children in the center
yeah
yeah
his mom did n't go back to work until when he was six months old
uh-huh
we just did n't want to dump him somewhere and make him feel like he was n't wanted
uh-huh
exactly
we wanted his center of attention at home we did what we could
uh-huh
it worked out real well
i 'm glad we were so careful
it 's difficult these day
it 's a lot more difficult these days because you have both parents working a lot of times
yeah
you have to find day care whereas here
most of the time now it 's a necessity
uh-huh
you ca n't afford
uh-huh
i 'm not making seventy or eighty thousand dollars a year
uh-huh
no choice
child care 's a necessity whereas years ago the husband basically worked and the wife basically stayed home
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
i 'm forty now
when i was a kid mom was always at home
right
we did n't
i think that has a lot to do with just all children how they learn and things just because the basic family is breaking
yeah
it is
yeah
it is
the basic family is not there anymore
i 'll agree with that it is
it 's not there
uh-huh
i think that plays a big part in a child 's learning and you know what they can and can not do in child care
yeah
i do n't think
been on the line for awhile
i almost forgot what the topic was
okay
based
i know what it is
okay
good
let me see
i i i i 'm kind of
i do n't
i 'm i 'm kind of in the middle
i think it 's a great idea
uh-huh
when it comes to me it 's almost an insult
it 's
i 've come from the teaching field
right
so do i
it 's just like i do n't know i guess i guess i 'd have to go with
uh-huh
i i would i would probably go for going ahead and doing it if it 's got to be done for everyone
right
i think if it 's got to be done for one person in the company it should be random testing it should be for everybody
right
when they answer the company i think it 'll make it a lot easier
right
yeah
i do n't know i come from the teaching field too
it sort of
it 's a pro and a con ty-
i do n't know where to stand on it
yeah
i 'm more or less if they told me i had to then fine if they made me then i 'd probably
yeah
if i had my druthers i 'd probably say no
just this
yeah
you kind of goes into your privacy i guess if they
right
there 's
i guess there 's some companies that are doing it
uh-huh
it seems to be working out
yeah
yeah
right
anybody who is does n't accept the rehab program then they 're more or less getting laid off
hard
that 's a
it 's really weird issue
i 'm sort of on the fence about it
yeah
yeah
i
that 's what 's they 're coming across as some of the companies anyhow
we can get you into a drug program
you wear that stigma
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
then i kind of hear it goes into
right
anything with a
if you drink a lot of caffeine or
i did n't know that
yeah
somebody was telling me if you drink it in an awful lot of caffeine that that can show up as a positive test
i know i 'm an epileptic
i 'd probably test positive i 'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system
yeah
things like that
yeah
a lot of times those are the things i do n't like to disclose to an employer because then they do n't want to have anything to do with you
right
right
uh-huh
it 's very personal
i would n't want to have it disclosed because then i 'd always wonder if they fired me why did you fire me
see that 's
yeah
that 's where i kind of get into
it kind of gets into your personal life what 's kind of next
uh-huh
yeah
the what
orwell
huh
oh
yeah
i sh-
i 'd hate to have to
if i had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who did n't
right
yeah
right
i can understand why they need it with all the train accidents and everything else
do you think they 'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually
i kind of think they will
i think they will too because it 's just going to follow
yeah
i do n't know we have n't had any of it in our school system hopefully we wo n't
yeah
we have n't either
yeah
i i just kind of think it 's heading that way though it 's just because it 's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff i just kind of think it 's going to eventually head that way
right
eventually it 's going to be not only the tea-
the kids are going to be under scrutiny it 's going to be the teachers
yeah
right
if they can test the teachers that gives them the full right to test the kids
right
they caught everybody
yeah
tell me about your home
my home
all right
my home is about fifteen years old
all right
it 's a two story house
it 's our first home
it looks like it 's going to be the last
i think we 're going to demolish it
we 've got two children
it 's
they have scraped the plaster off the walls with riding their little toys through it and stuff
yes
put dents in the tiles just multitude of them
even places
it 's past the dent stage
we 're talking some of it 's been away
i do n't know what they
we talking from dents in the holes
yeah
dents in the
right
i understand
i 've got a daughter
we 've got two
one of them 's eleven
one of them 's seven
the carpet
we need to replace the carpet
it sounds like it 's just the pits
it 's not all that bad
they 're just real hard on it
kids are hard on houses
definitely
i can see why people wait until they get in high school or maybe junior high
they get another one
yeah
yeah
we live in a mobile home
that 's probably not typical america
i know there 's a lot of them
it 's
what we have
it 's all we can afford
yeah because they 're always something
seems like we 're always working on it as i 'm sure it is with your house
yeah
how old is your child
ten
girl
just like yours ours is always
we 're
something else goes wrong always
it 's
some appliances breaking or something
no
appliances
we had a couple plumbing problems
we 've
who knows it 's always something with homes
you said you were in colorado springs
yes
are there a lot of trailers around there
yeah
there are there 's a big military constituency
is that what you 're in
no
no
i work for t i
then that 's why you 're doing this then is n't it
yes
okay
what division are you in
i 'm not in t i
oh
i had a friend that had a roommate that worked for t i
she saw this come up on the computer screen and ran it off and passed it to the people that were interested
it 's not a hobby
it 's something to do
i get to here about texas again a bit and get to talk to people all over the country
you know that i 've talked to someone in maryland i believe it was
i know i 've been talking to people in ohio and virginia and i think california
it 's interesting is n't it
yeah
it is
the gal i talked to in maryland did n't own a car
she 's never traveled anywhere
she 's never been anywhere
she
i talked about one of the biggest problems in the united states being our roads
she did n't understand
she does n't drive
how does she get to work
she lives on campus
she 's a college student
buses and public transportation
uh-huh
i had a re-
her parents live by the public transportation
i wish we could down here
it would be nice
i kind of like the freedom too do n't you
sometimes
i tell you i 'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work
if i did it it would take me an hour and fifteen minutes
i would have to get on one and drive or walk to a bu-
there 's one terminal close to us
they 'd drive me to the main terminal here
right
then i 'd have to go to downtown dallas and then walk over couple blocks and get on another bus to go to my school
if it 's anything like
that 's too much
dallas always has been
no one wants to be at downtown dallas much
yeah
there sure are a lot of people that work down there
is the crime rate still bad
definitely
i went down there a couple maybe three weeks ago for a trial
all these people were standing up that was during the workday all along the streets just all around these vacant buildings a lot of vacant buildings
they 're just being demolished
they stink
yeah
that 's terrible
uh-huh
garland how nice is it now
it 's been a while since i 've been there
i think it might be up to two hundred and fifty thousand
it 's gotten big
yes
it has
i think when we moved here it was like a hundred and twenty something like that
i did n't realize when i moved here that it was a separate town from dallas
yeah
it is
i know now
i did n't
where you from
i 'm from kilgore texas
it 's in east
kilgore
i know where kilgore is
where you from
i 'm originally from lubbock
are you
yeah
why did you move up to colorado
seemed like the thing to do at the time
it 's real pretty up there
i have a friend in denver
i love it the mountains
i love the mountains
what do you
back to the topic
what
it seems that more and more people are not owning traditional homes these days
they 're not owning homes period
yeah
yeah
everyone says
when i bought this several years ago when our local economy was good everyone said no no you 're crazy to buy a mobile home
uh-huh
now it seems that with the local economy bad and t i
it seems that
it was n't such a bad idea
they 're doing some back pedaling
have you got land
no
i 'm renting at the time
i did that one year
i lived with two other girls
we all taught
it was a two bedroom
we took turns sharing the bedroom
gosh
yeah
i got to where i decided i wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom
we had two baths
it was just the little bathroom were the thing that really bothered me because i felt real closed in
mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one
that was in the seventies
ours is wood sided
uh-huh
it has a traditional roof
i 'm sorry
it 's nine hundred and eighty square foot
what two bedroom one bath rooms are nice sized
uh-huh have you got it under
you can imagine nine hundred eighty square foot broke up into two bedrooms one bath
it 's comfy
yes
are you required to by law
we were down here
it was already setup when we bought it
yeah
i bet it 's not bad
yeah
it 's wood sided it has sheetrock everywhere
it 's quieter than you remember mobile homes to be
okay
how much is yours
when we bought ours we were paying three hundred twenty-nine dollars
our payments are like two twenty
for how many years
fifteen
it was still a lot cheaper
what
it was still a lot cheaper than what we gave because ours is thirty years
we bought one of the cheapest houses a tract house
yeah
yes
a mobile home 's a heck of a lot cheaper
which probably did n't make much difference
it did
in it
no
no
no
what i meant not in quality
what i meant was four years equity costs five hundred dollars
in the price
nice
that sounds good
there 's not that much time left on the loan
if the economy gets better are you going to get another house
i do n't know
no
to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our mobile home and have it so close to paid for
it 's like me to pickup and move somewhere else is easy
you would n't take that mobile home
right
sure
you would
sure
absolutely
it would be cheaper to move that than buy another one
absolutely
when you talk about the deal i got it would be cheaper
especially if it were a paid move or something
there 's some paid moves occasionally
t i would pay to move you
i do n't know
they did
when i moved up here
they might want to move away
how many years you been up there
six or seven
do you snow ski
a little bit
mostly i just love walking in the mountains driving in the mountains
it 's real pretty
i went rock climbing one time
that 's exciting
my friend talked me in that
i 'm a real scaredy when it comes to heights
once we got on top of the rocks it was quite
