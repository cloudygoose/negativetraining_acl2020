okay i guess we 're on <eou> yeah <eou> central america have you ever lived in central america <eou> i was n't in central america <eou> talking about latin america i consider latin america to include central and south america <eou> i did live in brazil for four years <eou> do you think that we should have given up the panama canal <eou> realistically i <eou> yes <eou> i do n't see the panama canal that has n't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it 's not really big enough to accommodate the shipping that it once did <eou> maybe it would be better that we let the panamanians run it however i think we 're certainly justified in our actions dealing with noriega in this <eou> there are those that that think that that the panama canal has some considerable strategic importance particularly for the military <eou> interestingly enough my father who was in world war one and as a civil engineer they they offered him a commission as a captain if he would go in and help with the defenses of the panama canal <eou> he had worked for united fruit company there <eou> uh-huh <eou> they in fact they had <eou> this was in the late twenties <eou> they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over <eou> he turned them down <eou> it 's interesting that most people do n't realize how small the canal is <eou> have you ever been there <eou> no <eou> i have n't <eou> it 's really <eou> i have n't been there <eou> i 've been to been to salvador <eou> in fact we went back to visit some friends of my fathers that we went in fifty-seven i guess <eou> interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite easily <eou> the thing i find interesting though is the whole colonial approach <eou> do we support the sandinistas or do we support <eou> they thought that nicaragua if you gave them a free election they would vote for the <eou> will you <eou> did you ever studied the political makeup there in in nicaragua <eou> i have a little bit <eou> i ca n't say that i would be an expert on on the region <eou> certainly it gets there <eou> your <eou> you 've got this toss up betw- <eou> not so much a toss up but a dilemma when you want a country to have its own dominion or its free rein over its own people <eou> we 're in this dilemma over united states believes in democracy and self determination where <eou> that <eou> on the other hand we believe in self preservation and not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about soviet influence in what 's considered to be the united states sphere of the world which is not only we used to see spheres <eou> now we 're in a situation where the united states looks like we 're it now <eou> the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic <eou> i do n't know if you read any of the history on where the panama canal <eou> there was an option to build it across nicaragua <eou> there 's a big there 's a big lake <eou> uh-huh <eou> from a technical standpoint it would n't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in nicaragua <eou> the united states had some <eou> i 've forgotten what the political influence was <eou> there were economic ties then <eou> the issue of <eou> if it 's in the economic interest of the united states do we go in and prevail <eou> in other words do we make the world safe for democracy <eou> right <eou> if there 's no economic benefit <eou> i think particularly if you 're looking at the at the peasant whether he 's in central america regardless of where he is is his life better off under communism or or democratic government <eou> you look at salvador where the <eou> he does n't care as long as he 's feeding his family <eou> yeah <eou> the question is does the government make a difference <eou> if they 'll mostly leave him alone <eou> i think that 's the difficulty that we have that it reality does n't make any difference if he has no income <eou> apparently even some of our alleged central american leaders that are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things <eou> it 's <eou> yeah <eou> yo- <eou> in looking bu- <eou> if you look at the region in <eou> to their detriment they came from this hundreds of years of spanish control <eou> the spaniards have horrible history of corrupt government greedy rulers who have been manipulating their public for their own good <eou> if you go back to the kings and the conquistadors coming in and the incredibly horrible things they did to the native tribes <eou> they make the things that custer did look trivial <eou> you get <eou> it is interesting that we look at the exploitation <eou> we accuse some other people of exploiting them <eou> americans have a pretty good reputation of exploiting <eou> basically the panama canal we went in took it <eou> absolutely <eou> we set up <eou> we stole it fair and square <eou> an <eou> teddy roosevelt did n't have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick for nothing <eou> right <eou> what 's america 's role there <eou> it <eou> with other things going on it seems to have lessened <eou> you 've still got cuba that exerts some influence <eou> the only thing i see about cuba though is after fidel castro dies i do n't think they 'll be a communist power anymore <eou> i ca n't see communism in that country carrying on past him <eou> when you take a situation where i think in particular in salvador where there is a significant under class <eou> that <eou> having a lot of difficulty surviving the question is would they be better off under communism <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know that i would advocate communism <eou> the question is can you can can a democracy afford the <eou> it 's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the u s that 's essentially an underclass <eou> right <eou> when you get enough of them communism would feed them all <eou> ye- <eou> i do n't know if maybe communism is the right word for it <eou> what we would <eou> there would have to be some kind of <eou> there may be a point at which you might want to consider some kind of socialistic organization or socialistic set up to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy <eou> that <eou> yeah <eou> if the guys got some incentive <eou> if he 's got <eou> if he can raise enough coffee and bananas to where he 's got something to protect <eou> other <eou> right <eou> right <eou> whether he can export or at least set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest <eou> cocoa leaves sell real well right now it seems <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments <eou> absolutely <eou> i do n't <eou> it 's going to be hard to <eou> we <eou> if you <eou> that 's where your absolutely right is we 've got to do something in that region to encourage or to make him growing bananas profitable again <eou> yes <eou> the question is if somebody offered a thousand dollars a day to grow something in your backyard would you do it <eou> right <eou> not that we could be bought <eou> i 've got to watch what i say here <eou> i never know when the d i a may be listening on my phone <eou> of course everything we 're saying is being recorded <eou> right <eou> of course <eou> of course <eou> yeah <eou> it 's tempting <eou> it 's got to be horribly tempting for those peasants <eou> particularly if you 're hungry <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> you <eou> it 's not just a matter of having an extra car or having a better car this is a matter for them of feeding themselves their wife and their family <eou> you <eou> there 's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family <eou> there 's dishonor in not being able to do it <eou> starving to death is not a whole lot of fun either <eou> that <eou> no <eou> no <eou> uh-huh <eou> in reality i think what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people and help them protect themselves <eou> not that they <eou> i 'm not sure the catholic church is is particularly political <eou> if <eou> right <eou>
are you a t ier <eou> no <eou> i 'm not <eou> really <eou> that 's great <eou> my daughter talked to a student <eou> in general most people doing this are t iers <eou> i guess customers too <eou> i think a great number of students who got word of it and participated in general and voiced who heard about the program <eou> yeah <eou> t is got a lot of advances in it really <eou> hopefully this will turn out to be a good program for us <eou> we sure need the business <eou> okay <eou> current events <eou> you 've got the question you can go first there since i called <eou> i rely primarily on newspaper combined with television <eou> that <eou> you 're the opposite of me <eou> i drive an hour each way to work <eou> if i just use time <eou> not say one which quality is the best <eou> i guess that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio <eou> newspapers and t v would be tied after that because maybe i 'll catch the evening news like ten o'clock on t v <eou> i <eou> that 's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper <eou> okay <eou> i really <eou> of course you 're in a different part of the country <eou> i really listen to a lot of the talk shows i do n't mean the gossip ones <eou> there 's a lot <eou> on the weekends when i do chores or whatever <eou> i 'm a radio hound i guess <eou> i take the radio with me when i 'm working on my car the lawn or whatever <eou> turn on <eou> they have everything from lawn work lawyers news veterinarians all kinds of items <eou> a real radio buff especially when i 'm doing chores <eou> that 's rather interesting <eou> yeah <eou> i find it surprising because a lot of times it here <eou> i 'll talk to some people here <eou> i 'll mention some talk host <eou> i 'll expect them to have an opinion on why i do n't like him and do n't listen <eou> they do n't even know what the guys name is bruce williams who does financial work all over the united states <eou> most people have n't heard of bruce williams <eou> you probably have n't either unless you 're a radio buff <eou> i 'd have to say i have n't either <eou> he is in new jersey and is entrepreneur and kind of a self-made millionaire <eou> he has it <eou> i <eou> it 's five seventy here <eou> i 'm trying to <eou> it 's on cliff <eou> i do n't know what the <eou> he 's on all stations <eou> you might remember the name bruce williams <eou> he is again national and talks about a lot of financial things <eou> the here i just get a kick out of <eou> we do a lot of gardening here <eou> there 's <eou> we have an excellent gardener here <eou> has three hours on sunday and three hours on saturday <eou> of course that 's not exactly current events <eou> i 'm i am kind of a radio buff <eou> i listen to the radio probably five or six hours a week <eou> almost inevitably to a station that is a classical station here for music purposes <eou> for music <eou> we do n't use the radio as a wake up <eou> we have a television connected to a electronic alarm system that kicks in <eou> yeah <eou> it comes on with c n n in the morning <eou> yeah <eou> that 's good <eou> that <eou> we wake up to television news and shower and dress and whatever to that <eou> because of the fact that my wife and i ride to work together in a car we chat at each other rather than something else <eou> that 's good <eou> occasionally what we 'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in the car <eou> we have the advantage of being able to read and drive although there seems to be from what i 've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving <eou> my wife always wonders about that <eou> she says look at that person he 's driving and reading at the same time <eou> we rely pretty heavily i think on a combination of the two <eou> i also use newsweek magazine <eou> yeah <eou> we tend to alternate between newsweek and time and whatever happens to be the news magazine of the year for us <eou> right <eou> we get <eou> i read sporadically of commentary and a couple of other trade magazines such as that where i might read the the occasional social and even current event commentaries and everything as diverse as a c m to some of the other tabloids i get <eou> i guess i use about eighty percent written is probably my input and twenty percent television i think i respect from a journalistic perspective current events <eou> i 've always said that it 's really not interesting unless it 's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline <eou> good point <eou> that 's a good point <eou> other than that it was a at best <eou> yeah <eou> it comes and goes <eou> we 're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in raleigh <eou> there are other <eou> i 'm not sure what you would call them the small competing independent sort of newspapers <eou> little small weekly things <eou> there 's only one daily called the news and observer fondly referred to here by some as the sometimes the noise and observer <eou> yeah <eou> it depends <eou> it has decent national coverage but has an extremely focused political coverage probably steeped in the southern history and the fact that this is a democratic state <eou> local you mean <eou> consequently everything is filtered through that republican democratic sort of glass almost unnecessarily <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> do n't they have city council meetings and all that <eou> are you into any of that what 's going on in the city council and the school boards and all that <eou> we have that addition to our paper <eou> yeah <eou> we have <eou> that is <eou> as a matter of fact they update it once a week with a special section <eou> we pay it sort of glancing nod <eou> we have a very good friend who is tapped into the city planning structure our developer architect friend <eou> you get it from people then <eou> right <eou> i think we find out what 's happening in the city on a fairly frequent basis over a gin and tonic sort of thing <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of raleigh than the paper would have anyway <eou> my wife and i as mentioned <eou> the question was do you get it from people too <eou> i can say the same thing you do that my wife she reads the paper from front to back <eou> she 'll tell me some stuff <eou> she 'll always get mad and say you did n't read the <eou> i always read the sports <eou> what am i thinking of the commentaries <eou> i ca n't even think of what it is offhand <eou> she 's always reading something <eou> she says why have n't you read that <eou> i say i never have time to read it like you do <eou> i always get a lot of my information from the newspaper through her <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i guess we do get it from people too <eou> you mentioned c n n of course i mentioned radio and the c n n t v news <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's the same thing that 's on the radio word for word <eou> is that right heard there was some stuff on the radio that was equivalent to c n n <eou> yeah <eou> okay <eou> it <eou> because <eou> we have it here at work as a matter if fact at t i <eou> okay <eou> we have it in the break area c n n <eou> the reason i say that is on the radio they 'll say look at this <eou> when i first heard c n n it only started about since the war or right before that <eou> they would always say look at this <eou> there would be a pause would be music and stuff <eou> i realized that it 's the exact commentary that you have on the the news <eou> that did n't <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it 's still good <eou> it 's still <eou> you do n't really miss anything <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do enjoy since the gulf war listening to c n n radio too as well as watching c n n on t v here at work <eou> i do n't have c n n at home <eou> let me turn this radio off <eou> i 'm at work right now believe it or not <eou> where was i <eou> i 'm <eou> go ahead <eou> your turn <eou> we probably were listening to c n n fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began <eou> we almost live and breathed it because during the war itself to the point where we began to sort of have household pact of lets turn the war off and get something done <eou> yeah <eou> i 've heard that <eou> yeah <eou> almost an addition <eou> we could equate or relate relay well to some of the newspaper and television articles about the fact that people where having this problem in uncoupling from the events and going on with their <eou> right <eou> instead of watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever <eou> because of that we began towards the middle of the war i guess about two and a half or three weeks in we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would watch fifteen minutes before fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news or our local news <eou> we would watch c n n until six thirty then we would watch a rotating network news of a b c c b s n b c <eou> we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one <eou> right <eou> we would turn the television off <eou> we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on news that way <eou> we would do a similar thing at ten forty-five because c n n would be wrapping their hourly coverage up <eou> we would get the local coverage <eou> i think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would have better state coverage rather than local coverage <eou> three of the networks here on their local news <eou> that <eou> if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who murdered who or stole what from whom <eou> yeah <eou> that was the sort of thing that i would say is the best ( ( mumblex <eou> ) ) not news <eou> yeah <eou> unless there 's some trend or something that says this neighborhood has been hit forty-seven times or whatever that 's sort of more of a pattern news <eou> i never get home early enough for those five and six o'clock <eou>
okay <eou> what do you think of the public school system <eou> first off do you have children that are in it <eou> i have children that are in the plano public school systems <eou> i am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school system <eou> okay <eou> then you should be a good one to know because my children are grown now <eou> i now have grandchildren in the school system <eou> oh <eou> i do n't have firsthand experience right now with it <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> what do you think <eou> i think the public school systems are doing a good job <eou> i think they have a long way to go yet <eou> i think that they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier <eou> you know my kindergartners were on the computers <eou> i think that with the way the world is today that 's got to be done <eou> i think that the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them skills <eou> right <eou> you figure out why you 're adding it and what you 're going to do with it once you 've got it together <eou> i think that that 's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids can not think <eou> they literally can not come in out of the rain <eou> that 's right <eou> that just <eou> i do n't care how intelligent you are if you be can not make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted <eou> right <eou> this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why i went into education <eou> i think they 're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have <eou> i think that 's very very important <eou> yes <eou> it is <eou> i agree with you that they 're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren <eou> we have a fourth grader <eou> we have one that 's in kindergarten <eou> i know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children were doing in the fifth and sixth grade <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i tutor a girl that 's in eighth grade <eou> her pre-algebra book is higher then some of my algebra two when i was in high school <eou> is that scary <eou> it 's like i going to take this home and study it before i can help you <eou> right <eou> they 're really moving them along <eou> yet at the same time they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life <eou> that 's wha- <eou> a lot of the things that we did in school i 've never used and never will use <eou> yes <eou> i think that it 's appropriate to teach them why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this <eou> correct <eou> are you finding that since you 're doing substitute that you 're wanting to do full-time <eou> i have a friend that 's a teacher that one of her complaints is she ca n't teach because she 's so busy filling out all the forms <eou> yes <eou> that 's a <eou> d- <eou> do you find that <eou> filling out the forms and also all of these statewide and national wide testing things so that they compare <eou> uh-huh <eou> as far as i 'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's just a matter of how you 're going to interpret it <eou> you waste so much time quote unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they 're possibly going to be that i think it 's crazy personally <eou> be <eou> uh-huh <eou> the whole first nine weeks of school is used as a review <eou> more than a review they 're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in october so that you know your school district shines throughout the united states <eou> coming up <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think that 's totally useless <eou> i think there 's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons <eou> i think they 've taken it to the extent now that it 's just ridiculous <eou> it 's like bragging on your grandchildren <eou> right <eou> everybody 's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth <eou> nobody else 's children are going to ever live up to this <eou> that 's great <eou> that 's what they 're doing with the school systems <eou> they 're wasting too much time on that i think <eou> i know that this friend is in the plano school district <eou> uh-huh <eou> she teaches emotionally disturbed children <eou> uh-huh <eou> she says she has six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade <eou> yes <eou> because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they 're passed on or something <eou> i did n't quite understand it <eou> yeah <eou> there 's a <eou> yeah <eou> the bottom line is always money <eou>
in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that i know and lawyers and whatnot i think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem <eou> do you <eou> why <eou> why <eou> if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students so they could become doctors the problem would go away <eou> you think the problem is not enough doctors <eou> i think the problem is that the doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor you are going to pay high premiums on your liability <eou> gosh for one thing <eou> oh <eou> uh-huh <eou> you think there are plenty of doctors <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't think there is a shortage of doctors <eou> i do know that o b which is my field the doctors ' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year that deliver babies <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's astronomical <eou> they ca n't doing anything about that <eou> i do n't think they 're in a conspiracy <eou> i think it 's our fault because we as people just sue them <eou> no <eou> people do n't sue <eou> people are very sue conscious <eou> lawyers sue <eou> if you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor <eou> yeah <eou> that 's probably true too <eou> people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days <eou> sure <eou> when you think about reasonableness i believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory <eou> you know what tort theory is <eou> no <eou> a tort is when you do something wrong <eou> right <eou> it <eou> an o b g y n doctor can not control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent <eou> that 's right <eou> if the baby is born dead that happens <eou> if they have complications and <eou> it depends <eou> i know there are guys that are real slobs <eou> there are also people out there that are really doing their job <eou> that 's true <eou> they are because doctors are performing many more tests <eou> many of them are unnecessary <eou> they are doing so many c sections just to prevent <eou> just to prevent a a law suit <eou> they have all these monitors now <eou> if anything looks even a little bit funny their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby <eou> yeah <eou> { c and so } it 's costing more all around in health insurance for tests for surgery for longer hospital stay <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> i believe that there is a system already in place for health care <eou> it 's terrible <eou> uh-huh <eou> they have indigent health care <eou> you show up at parkland bleeding <eou> you 'll get it <eou> that 's true <eou> in fact you 'll get it at presbyterian if you show up there too <eou> yeah <eou> we have that happen <eou> we have patients that go through parkland through the clinic <eou> uh-huh <eou> at the last minute they come to us we ca n't turn them away <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> i think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation the problem would pretty much evaporate <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm for that <eou> i 've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer i 'd like to wipe them all out <eou> yeah <eou> i happen to know a few <eou> i even claim one as a friend <eou> he 's a divorce attorney <eou> he better not be mine <eou> i think he 'll go nameless for the purposes of this conversation <eou> i also know an o b g y n who has stopped practicing <eou> yeah <eou> some they do <eou> he just said <eou> they stop their o b at least <eou> yeah <eou> he 's not going to deliver any more babies ever <eou> right <eou> right <eou> his malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year <eou> that 's incredible <eou> he said he had to gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice <eou> yeah <eou> most of them are very sincere <eou> most of them do the best they can <eou> yeah <eou> they are human <eou> occasionally something will go wrong <eou> you can be human and catholic <eou> i know you can be human and catholic <eou> you 're not likely to find somebody who is going to have a less conscientious effort <eou> yeah <eou> no <eou> most of them do <eou> i really believe that <eou> from dealing with doctors dealing with lawyers there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious <eou> who is getting rich <eou> insurance companies <eou> yeah <eou> they are <eou> if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance <eou> say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed <eou>
greg <eou> i 'm not familiar <eou> i think you guys in indiana do n't you have the death penalty <eou> yeah <eou> we do have the death penalty here <eou> it 's not exercised very often <eou> we do have it <eou> uh-huh <eou> i believe it <eou> uh-huh <eou> i know there 's a lot of problems with it seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that the person i feel does n't deserve to live does n't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in prison for life <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> i know there 's a lot of problems with that like they say if you put them on death row and execute them then ten years later you find out that he really did n't do it then that life was wasted just seems like in some cases that it 's a good policy <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i tend to agree with you <eou> i 've changed my views even within the last few years to be honest <eou> when i was an undergraduate i was a member of amnesty international <eou> uh-huh <eou> of course at that time i thought it was stupid to kill anybody for <eou> that <eou> the eye for an eye was a stupid argument <eou> right <eou> the the more <eou> now i live in downtown dallas i 've seen i 've seen cases in the news and all where a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder <eou> right <eou> right <eou> i think that maybe a good solution to capital punishment might be reserve it solely for repeat offenders of a crime like murder <eou> that 's a thought that i had never really had on that which seems pretty sensible <eou> yeah <eou> it seems sensible and failsafe <eou> i i do n't <eou> not completely failsafe <eou> if a man 's convicted of two murders there 's a pretty good chance that something 's wrong <eou> right <eou> i also <eou> to tell you how liberal i have turned toward this or or whatever side that is i 've kind of chosen i believe it that big time drug importers like noriega for example that these people need to be eliminated from society <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because really any kind of jail sentence for them is just another chance to create another power structure <eou> yeah <eou> you 're right there <eou> i gue- <eou> basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they 're going to be there for life they 're never going to be rehabilitated <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> right <eou> i do n't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with <eou> right <eou> to me i 'm paying taxes twenty percent of my check or whatever to keep somebody alive who i in my mind should n't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'm all in favor of it <eou> uh-huh <eou> do you <eou> are there cases where you think that the capital punishment should n't be sentenced <eou> i really do n't know on that question <eou> it just seems like <eou> for instance the jeffrey dahlmer case i do n't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society <eou> i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets <eou> uh-huh <eou> in that case wisconsin does n't have a death penalty <eou> he 's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment <eou> right <eou> i think that he should not be allowed to live <eou> then you 're kind of playing god which is never a good thing to do <eou> that 's true <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld not really that i can think of <eou> i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do n't really agree with the death penalty for people like noriega and such as that <eou> i think that they 're operating on a more <eou> i know that they 're causing massive problems in society up here <eou> i do n't really think that it 's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you do n't deserve to live because they 're feeding our consumer needs <eou> right <eou> sure <eou> yeah <eou> i understand your point <eou> yeah <eou> of course with with dahlmer now you realize that i think it 's ohio gets to try him next they do have the death penalty <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> that was a curious case <eou> i <eou> yeah <eou> that is very curious <eou> something is sort of nightmarish to say the least <eou> yeah <eou> that 's right <eou> here in texas we <eou> i think even this last week they had another they <eou> they use their capital punishment by lethal injection <eou>
okay <eou> first how much television watching do you do <eou> i do a little bit more than i think usual people do because i am here alone during the day <eou> uh-huh <eou> i like it just for the noise <eou> that 's right <eou> do you actually watch it pay attention to it <eou> is it more of a company <eou> it just depends on what it is <eou> uh-huh <eou> i have my favorite things that i do <eou> uh-huh <eou> okay <eou> some fun thing to do sometime <eou> right <eou> what about you <eou> i work full time <eou> when i am not working i am running <eou> i do not watch a lot of television <eou> i am very selective in what i watch <eou> right <eou> if there 's something that i absolutely want to watch i will turn it on and watch it and then turn it off <eou> i probably watch television four hours a week max <eou> that 's great <eou> yeah <eou> if i do not find something that i really want or really want to watch then i just do not turn it on <eou> i would rather listen to music <eou> right <eou> part of it is that i think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis <eou> i think that if we are doing other things and these programs come in sometimes they influence us <eou> we do not know where that influence came from <eou> i think that 's partially true too <eou> yeah <eou> i think you have to have the will and the <eou> i think it <eou> right <eou> right <eou> right <eou> you would be susceptible to stuff <eou> of course i <eou> it has to be reinforced at another level too <eou> that 's <eou> do you like specials <eou> last night for example i really would have liked to have watched unsolved mysteries <eou> those are fascinating to me <eou> oh <eou> if i have the opportunity i watch it <eou> unfortunately i was with someone else who was flipping channels <eou> oh <eou> i hate that <eou> i do not care a whole lot for some of the contemporary humor <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> in our comedy programs although <eou> nobody can appreciate comedy any more than i can <eou> i would prefer to find a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians <eou> we have cable also <eou> uh-huh <eou> sometimes you can get the h b o specials <eou> sometimes those are really pretty hysterical <eou> uh-huh <eou> i like to watch comedy <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's something <eou> i enjoy comedy <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i guess i have my old favorites <eou> uh-huh <eou> bob newhart is still on <eou> uh-huh <eou> i watch him <eou> i enjoy that <eou> uh-huh <eou> something on that level <eou> uh-huh <eou> i also enjoy <eou> i do not know <eou> sunday mornings it 's channel thirteen <eou> i watch a lot of thirteen the mclaughlin group i just laugh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's right <eou> i think that 's so hysterical these guys <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's just so much fun <eou> it 's just a lot of fun watching that <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do not agree with a whole lot of the stuff the they say <eou> right <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> i like to be entertained <eou> i really do <eou> yeah <eou> i watch it for entertainment <eou> i also watch it for cultural impact <eou> i do a lot of channel thirteen channel three some of the educational channels <eou> i watch for special programs that have a special play a special concert <eou> i recently watched a tribute to three of the finest opera stars <eou> that was fabulous <eou> it was fabulous <eou> that <eou> i was just absolutely <eou> yeah <eou> you just held you breath in some of those <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i was just <eou> it makes chills all over you <eou> i know <eou> i may or may not even look at the t v guide <eou> if i have time i may flip through and say this looks good if i finish this task i can watch that in an hour <eou> if the hour comes and i do not get a chance to watch it so what <eou> there 's certain thin- <eou> uh-huh <eou> i have got my t v in the kitchen here <eou> uh-huh <eou> i love to watch cooking shows <eou> i really do <eou> i do too <eou> it makes me want to cook <eou> i know <eou> i eat <eou> i get fat <eou> i just let other people watch <eou> i <eou> yeah <eou> then i eat what they cook <eou> there 's some <eou> in fact one of the water color shows i know has inspired me to take water color lessons <eou> i think that 's marvelous <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i took a lot of my college courses <eou> i took some of my college courses on television <eou> yeah <eou> that <eou> it 's very successful for some of those things <eou> oh <eou> i think i really got stung very badly about having influence in your life <eou> at least i saw a very bad example of having television influence your life <eou> my husband had an aunt who was addicted to soaps <eou> uh-huh <eou> i want you to know that became the most suspicious cantankerous contrary old woman ever walked <eou> she got you a <eou> absolutely <eou> i do not know who she thought she was <eou> she just got to the point where you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice and that attitude being demonstrated <eou> yeah <eou> for her to miss a soap it was a big withdrawal <eou> that 's <eou> she was probably depressed to begin with <eou> i do not know <eou> you know what i mean <eou> she was grumpy to begin with <eou> yeah <eou> grumpy to begin with <eou> yeah <eou> there 's no doubt about that <eou> you could clearly see those influences in my youngsters <eou> uh-huh <eou> i know that one day my youngsters were watching the three stooges <eou> i always thought that was just casual slap stick comedy <eou> i hate that show <eou> when one tries to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench i decided that was not funny any more i really feel very strong about the bart simpson show <eou> yeah <eou> i <eou> good <eou> i think that is <eou> the kids watch that <eou> that 's absolutely the mouthiest kid i ever saw <eou> i do not like it <eou> is not that amazing <eou> how old are your kids <eou> mine are grown <eou> i have grandchildren and young children around <eou> okay <eou> that 's <eou> yeah <eou> for a four year old to think bart simpson is a hero is tragic <eou> i had forgotten about that <eou> it 's just my husband and i of the kids shows and all that <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know <eou> i was very careful even when my kids were at home <eou> yeah <eou> when they were young i really did watch what they watched <eou> i was cau- <eou> i sat down with them <eou> i watched it <eou> if i did not like it i changed the channel for them <eou> right <eou> right <eou> i just wou- <eou> we get it at school too <eou> you might as well not reinforce it <eou> sure <eou> that 's right <eou> that 's right <eou> gosh <eou> they are mouthy enough anyway <eou> i remember going to sch- <eou> my parents were a lot like too <eou> uh-huh <eou> kids all the watch rawhide and all those shows <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> my parents never let me watch anything like that <eou> i could watch yogi bear <eou> uh-huh <eou> what kind of culture was that <eou> yeah <eou> i remember going to school the next day <eou> everybody would be asking did you see that did you see how he did that <eou> uh-huh <eou> did you see <eou> i could never participate <eou> uh-huh <eou> it always made me feel a little bit a loner <eou> i <eou> sure <eou> i can understand how that would happen <eou> then my parents <eou> absolutely <eou> i did <eou> to <eou> i ran my kids to death <eou> i said i think that 's enough television for awhile <eou> really <eou> maybe we need to go outside <eou> yeah <eou> we need to go out and play and enjoy some company <eou> i would go out with them <eou> there 's the problem parents do not do that <eou> they say you go outside and play <eou> that 's true <eou> you go rent a video up at the store and come home and sit down and watch it <eou> yeah <eou> i said <eou> we did other things <eou> i think that was <eou> that 's something people do not do <eou> here we are talking on that subject <eou> that 's an interesting concept <eou> i have got to stick in my <eou> of course <eou> work with kids <eou>
okay <eou> do you participate in family reunions <eou> i did for years <eou> i do n't have enough family left to have them <eou> uh-huh <eou> did you <eou> were they far away <eou> were they close <eou> i come from a family that was very large in bell county <eou> uh-huh <eou> my grandfather came to bell county on a covered wagon and had ten children <eou> how neat <eou> sometimes we would have a reunion with that group <eou> uh-huh <eou> sometimes we would go to arkansas where they came from and have a reunion with the entire group <eou> that would be fun <eou> yeah <eou> it was a lot of fun <eou> yeah <eou> we have a family reunion on my mother 's side of the family that 's <eou> it started probably about forty years ago because i remember going as a teenager before i was ever married <eou> my husband and i went while we were still dating <eou> it 's still going on <eou> it used to be held at lake brownwood down at brownwood texas <eou> now we hold it at lake texoma so that the oklahoma group does n't have to drive as far <eou> uh-huh <eou> we have had as many on a saturday night <eou> it starts on friday and goes through sunday <eou> we 've had as many on a saturday night as about two hundred and fifty <eou> we would have group like that in arkansas <eou> uh-huh <eou> we 'd have two hundred and fifty or three hundred <eou> yes <eou> we took <eou> our family all brought in food and everything <eou> many of us came from a long way that we 'd usually at a motel <eou> we bought food there <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i know on sundays we all elect now to chip in <eou> we go get kentucky fried chicken and bring out <eou> uh-huh <eou> we kind of take our food for three days <eou> now our grandchildren are participating in it just love that they have all this little batch of cousins that they get to see about once a year <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> enthused and with it <eou> our children thoroughly enjoy it <eou> right <eou> it 's been kind of nice <eou> it started out when i was a youngster and watching my mother <eou> now i 'm to the mother was <eou> uh-huh <eou> i am now the older generation and doing more of the cooking and watching my daughter more and everything <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's something i really miss because i had twenty-seven first cousins <eou> my word <eou> we were very close family <eou> our father 's generation was enough older than i <eou> my father would be a hundred now that they 're all dead <eou> uh-huh <eou> in fact many of my first cousins are dead <eou> are they <eou> of course they have their own families and grandchildren and all that <eou> we very rarely all of us get together <eou> get together any more <eou> we 're a long way away <eou> the younger generation the next like my cousin 's children i do n't know very well <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> it <eou> it 's <eou> i doubt that that will come to be again <eou> as long as my oldest aunt lived we we got together once a year <eou> i do think now we have noticed a waning of interest <eou> as parents get older and start dying off i think sometimes it is hard to keep the interest going <eou> folks have gotten so mobile <eou> i have a son and a daughter and two nephews that are grown and a brother who has a new marriage and a younger son <eou> uh-huh <eou> my brother and his wife live in nevada my daughter lives in colorado one of my nephews lives in new york city one nephew lives in memphis and my son lives here <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think it 's very unlikely we 'll have a family reunion <eou> yeah <eou> you probably do good just to get your immediate family together <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm divorced <eou> really only immediate family i have left is my <eou> i have a son and a daughter <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> my family 's really all dead <eou> uh-huh <eou> it was great pleasure while we did it <eou> yeah <eou> they 're a lot of fun <eou> my si- <eou> i have a sister <eou> we have a son and a daughter <eou> we have three grandchildren <eou> uh-huh <eou> our son and daughter are both married <eou> our son 's not as interested in it as our daughter <eou> our daughter is really interested <eou> does it bother you if your children are not interested in it <eou> i beg you pardon <eou> does it bother you if your children are not interested in it <eou> a little bit <eou> i wish that our son was <eou> uh-huh <eou> the cousins are closer to our daughter 's age than to our son 's and just totally different interest group <eou> plus <eou> he 's newly married and does n't have children <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'm hoping that as they are married a little bit longer and have children that they may be more inclined to want to go to it <eou> uh-huh <eou> i know that <eou> what kinds of things do you do to try to get your children interested <eou> just talk to them about it <eou> talk to them about it and tell them some of the things we 're doing <eou> when he was a preteen when he was like ten or twelve he loved going <eou> uh-huh <eou> he had another cousin he was close to and went <eou> that cousin kind of quit going <eou> as he got to be a teenager he was n't quite as interested <eou> he was more interested in rock and roll <eou> this is more country western group <eou> uh-huh <eou> just lack of interest <eou>

know all the farmers got their first cut of hay and everything <eou> they 're going to need some rain to get the second cut <eou> oh <eou> i 'm working for a lady who has a strawberry field <eou> if we do n't have rain she 's going to lose a lot of money <eou> my goodness <eou> we have been drenched <eou> oh <eou> we have had so much rain for may and june that we 've got all the weather people down here really confused <eou> my <eou> we <eou> it 's probably <eou> it 's just <eou> it 's usually dry down there is n't it <eou> yeah <eou> right now <eou> by now it 's usually <eou> no <eou> it 's quit raining by at least a month <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's still <eou> we 're still having april showers for june <eou> i hope they come this way <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know where it came from <eou> it 's been really <eou> we got a lot of <eou> we 're in central texas <eou> it feels like we live in houston <eou> really <eou> yeah <eou> it it <eou> it rained today <eou> it just kind of steamed everything up <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's been great because we have n't had to use our sprinkler system <eou> we 've had some with really really high winds that have trashed trees and everything else <eou> my <eou> it 's just <eou> everyone up here with their gardens they 're not going to have much of a garden this year because it 's so dry <eou> yeah <eou> i hope you get some of that <eou> yeah <eou> we got enough <eou> we have had plenty <eou> we 're still forecast for more <eou> really <eou> yeah <eou> gee <eou> is california getting rain then <eou> i 'm not real sure <eou> i think a lot of this is coming out of <eou> i think what 's happen- of <eou> it 's coming out of canada <eou> out of the gulf <eou> it 's meeting what 's coming out of the gulf <eou> oh <eou> it 's just causing chaos <eou> yeah <eou> it 's been wet <eou> uh-huh <eou> we 've moved our yard i think three or four times in the last two or three weeks <eou> my gosh <eou> just because it just keeps growing and growing and growing <eou> one week it just rained thunderstormed for a day straight <eou> you could n't get out there <eou> uh-huh <eou> you just could n't get out there <eou> by the time you finally got out there where your lawn mower would n't sink we were <eou> yeah <eou> lawn mower broke <eou> now we need <eou> we could use two days straight of rain <eou> oh <eou> it 's really drying up here <eou> what always works for me is if i water my plants or we wash the car it usually rains <eou> if not that night the next day <eou> does it <eou> i was telling everyone hang your clothes out on the line <eou> it 's surely going to rain <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> whenever you hang your clothes out on the line it always rains <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> we 've had real hot weather <eou> hotter than usual <eou> yeah <eou> yes <eou> we <eou> let me think <eou> i got out of school in may <eou> in march i was wearing shorts <eou> wow <eou> i was wearing shorts in march up at college <eou> we w- <eou> what they said is that this area has had its summer weather in the spring <eou> is what they said what happened <eou> i hope that <eou> i do n't know <eou> i hope that does n't mean we 're going to get an early winter <eou> no <eou> i would n't think so <eou> i would n't <eou> not as early as it came <eou> your talking september maybe <eou> yeah <eou> that 's a little early <eou> still the <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> i was wearing shorts in march <eou> you know it was nippy <eou> uh-huh <eou> it was still in the seventies <eou> yeah <eou> high sixties low seventies in march <eou> yeah <eou> we were in new jersey last october <eou> uh-huh <eou> it was hotter there than it was here <eou> yes <eou> it was just like a heat wave <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> we have n't <eou> we just died <eou> my gosh <eou> it was really hot i like it here <eou> i would n't trade it for snow any day <eou> really <eou> yeah <eou> i like the snow <eou> i like to watch it fall <eou> i just like it where it 's deep enough but not too deep <eou> right <eou> i can handle a vacation in it <eou> my husband is from new jersey <eou> he would n't go back either <eou> he did all the shoveling and everything else <eou> really <eou> he said it was a pain <eou> is n't it weird at christmas time without snow <eou> no <eou> i do n't think so <eou> see last year we had snow at christmas time <eou> oh <eou> it was weird because we had snow <eou> it 's like wow it actually fell on the right day <eou> no <eou> it 's not <eou> in fact we 're used to running around in spring clothes in december <eou> when it throws in a real cool winter we get broken pipes and all that kind of stuff because texas just is n't built for real cold weather for long periods of time <eou> yeah <eou> it 's real dry down there <eou> you do n't have the humidity either do you <eou> no <eou> not were we are <eou> now in houston and stuff they 've got it where no hairsprayer works <eou> it 's so humid at times <eou> here it 's just about right <eou> it 's pretty dry and not too dry where it hurts to breathe we 're just about right <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> we 're just having all this rain <eou> late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable <eou> made the humidity real high <eou> yeah <eou> muggy huh <eou> no <eou> i like it <eou> we 're right in a good stop because we get over the hundreds in the summer <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's not it 's a dry heat <eou> it 's not really as hot and muggy as it would be being over a hundred plus ninety percent humidity <eou> yeah <eou> that 's what 's bad up here is when we do get the real hundred and the high nineties we have the humidity to go with it <eou> oh <eou> you 're real mucky <eou> you <eou> your legs stick together just from walking <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i know what <eou> we like it where we 're at <eou> if it 's not a whole bunch of everything at once type stuff <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> no <eou> it 's interesting when it gets really cold here <eou> people forget that they 're live in texas <eou> they do n't know how to drive in snow i would n't trade it for anything <eou> that 's good <eou> i was born in texas <eou> i visited other areas <eou> i 'm just a sun person i think <eou> i 've gotten used to it <eou> i do n't know <eou> i guess that 's really about all <eou> yeah <eou> weather is not real hard to talk about <eou> it does n't last real long either <eou> i thought the weather is the last thing you talk about <eou> in this case it 's the only thing to talk about <eou> michelle it 's great talking to <eou>
okay <eou> i guess first of all i 'll just say we have n't done much gardening <eou> we do lawn work all the time <eou> our gardening we lost <eou> remember the last two freezes <eou> i do n't know how long you 've been here <eou> yeah <eou> i do <eou> we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones <eou> as far as our bushes we do n't have any <eou> we do have some blackberry bushes they were really hearty and stayed on <eou> really <eou> we 've done really well with them <eou> did you plant those yourself <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> oh <eou> they 've been really good <eou> the kids i had to <eou> the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries <eou> we go out <eou> it 's hard to go out when it 's this hot <eou> uh-huh <eou> keep the weeds out of them and keep them off the ground so the ants do n't eat them <eou> they 're okay <eou> oh <eou> yeah <eou> that 's nice <eou> i love blackberries <eou> we <eou> when i was smaller my family lived in tennessee <eou> there used to be wild blackberries that we 'd go out and pick my brother and i <eou> i do n't have any down here <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> we have some flowers that have <eou> they 're just are real hearty also <eou> they 're bold <eou> they come up every year <eou> they 're getting too thick <eou> i need to go thin them out <eou> i do n't know what kind of flowers they are <eou> they 're real common around here <eou> they 're orange <eou> they look like a lily sort of <eou> i think i know what they <eou> i ca n't remember what the name of them are either <eou> no <eou> i think they 're real pretty when it rains because their petals do n't soak the rain in <eou> they keep the rain on the outside little rain drops <eou> oh <eou> they look real pretty after the rain <eou> i really like them <eou> i need to get out and do that <eou> as far as our grass it grows crazy here <eou> it just keeps growing and growing <eou> sometimes my son does it <eou> it just is <eou> i do n't know <eou> i 've lived in utah my whole life <eou> we ca n't seem to get ours green <eou> i do n't know <eou> down here the grass <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm <eou> we 've had problems with our yard <eou> we <eou> it was one big weed is what it was <eou> uh-huh <eou> it was just horrible <eou> my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns <eou> we have this god awful ugly thing i know they must think i wish those people would do something about their yard <eou> crappy i know <eou> we have that too <eou> my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff that seems to be helping <eou> he put it on the front yard to see how it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard <eou> uh-huh <eou> we 've got a great dane in the back <eou> uh-huh <eou> she has eaten everything i have put out there <eou> she 's eaten my crepe myrtle trees <eou> dear <eou> i know <eou> she 's eaten the bushes <eou> i 've tried to i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there <eou> no <eou> i barricaded it up so she could n't get into it <eou> uh-huh <eou> i went and took a shower and looked back out there <eou> she was already in it <eou> i was so mad <eou> had somehow gotten in <eou> i ca n't do anything back <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i 've tried out in the front <eou> like you said that freeze that came <eou> uh-huh <eou> i had some shrubs i put out front <eou> it killed those too <eou> i 'm just real discouraged with the whole thing <eou> i just do n't even want to do anything <eou> the other problem that we have <eou> it 's funny because the two bushes on the ends of the house that i think are ugly they lived <eou> i do n't know <eou> yeah <eou> that happened to us <eou> we have these <eou> i wanted to go out and kill them too <eou> i know <eou> they had no right to live <eou> anyway under our trees we get a north sun <eou> the <eou> it looks like our trees do n't have any grass under them <eou> i know <eou> ours do n't <eou> we just ca n't grow grass underneath there <eou> i know <eou> we ca n't either <eou> i 've got two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard one on either side of the yard <eou> uh-huh <eou> they 're big <eou> they 're real full and everything in the summer time <eou> it 's killing everything underneath where the leaves are shading the tree <eou> yeah <eou> toward the end of the summer when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing <eou> by then it 's so late then the winter comes and it stops <eou> it 's it 's a never ending cycle <eou> right <eou> it 's a vicious cycle is n't it <eou> yeah <eou> it really is <eou> it just really <eou> we 've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and whatnot <eou> i do n't <eou> we 've never done anything like this <eou> we 've been thinking if we built up a wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some flowers some new bushes in there that would live <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think that we 're going to try that <eou> huh <eou> i i think that 's pretty much what we have decided <eou> i have two long windows <eou> yeah <eou> really <eou> c- <eou> i do n't really have to worry about that that much because my sons ' bedrooms are in the front <eou> they 've got mini-blinds and stuff <eou> yeah <eou> only one is really in the flower bed part <eou> the other one is out on the porch <eou> yeah <eou> there 's not really much i can do about that <eou> that 's what our two rooms are on the front too with these long windows <eou> one is a bedroom for our oldest son <eou> one is an office that my husband and i work in <eou> i really do n't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that <eou> the flowers are out by the back of the house <eou> that 's why the front room is <eou> that 's not too bad <eou> yeah <eou> i like to look at the flowers <eou> they 're pretty <eou> i do too <eou> that 's why i look at my neighbors yard <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't have anything to look at <eou> i look at theirs <eou> it 's funny because you try so hard i think sometimes to to do our yard <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's like the wind blows everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them <eou> yeah <eou> even if you did get it under control it seems like in just a few months it would all be back <eou> yeah <eou> it 's really a pain <eou> my husband works a lot <eou> a lot <eou> it 's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm <eou> it 's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard i really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it <eou> uh-huh <eou> i hate to mow the yard more than anything else <eou> i hate to mow that yard <eou> i know <eou> it 's not my favorite thing in the world either <eou> i 'm glad i have an old enough son to do it for me now <eou> yeah <eou> mine 's getting there <eou> he helps <eou> he does half <eou> i do half <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> that is one chore that we will pay him for if he 'll go do the yard work out outside <eou> sure i 'll be more then glad to pay him if he 'd just go out there and do it and do it to where i do n't have to go back out and redo it <eou> right <eou> exactly <eou> that 's my only thing with him <eou> exactly <eou> that 's why i 'm having him help me now <eou>
i think you got it <eou> okay <eou> my first thoughts on capital punishment i- <eou> i <eou> the first thing i want to say is no just simply because we as human beings do n't have the right to take another human being 's life <eou> uh-huh <eou> we are punishing someone for taking someone 's life <eou> in some cases we are punishing a person for taking someone 's life <eou> in effect we are committing that same crime <eou> it sounds like you have really strong views on it <eou> uh-huh <eou> i can see that point <eou> i also have this <eou> i question <eou> i guess i can look at it both ways <eou> just to play devil 's advocate it never seems right to me that we take in people that are criminals and people that are low income or even middle income that are struggling to provide for their families <eou> right <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> our taxes are paying to feed and shelter those people <eou> ac- <eou> it just <eou> that i find very difficult to swallow sometimes <eou> uh-huh <eou> one thing i do n't understand is the whole concept of death row <eou> uh-huh <eou> okay <eou> these people are supposedly i guess waiting to die <eou> right <eou> i 'm with you there <eou> okay <eou> there are thousands upon thousands of people on death row <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'm not saying that <eou> i guess i am kind of saying what are we doing <eou> i guess that 's the same thing you were saying <eou> what are we doing with these people <eou> ha- <eou> they 're there <eou> we should take some kind of action take enough go a different route <eou> right <eou> exactly <eou> they 're just <eou> when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs we could be poor people and helping the environment <eou> exactly <eou> uh-huh <eou> prison is such a waste of a human being <eou> uh-huh <eou> it does n't do anyone any good <eou> exactly <eou> yes <eou> people need to be punished <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do agree with your statement that to take a human life is wrong <eou> right <eou> act- <eou> locking someone up and not getting any benefit from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too <eou> uh-huh <eou> i guess i see both sides in that at the same time that i 'm saying that we 're committing the same crime <eou> uh-huh <eou> i also agree that if there is somebody out there that 's crazy and cruel enough to kill somebody or in some cases kill several people at one time <eou> uh-huh <eou> exactly w- <eou> there was a case in dallas <eou> i 'm sure they have n't gone to court yet <eou> apparently two teenage boys held up a taco bell <eou> they put four people in a freezer and shot them all <eou> to me that is inhumane <eou> for two people to be out in the world like that i do n't want them in my world <eou> that 's right <eou> you understand what i am saying <eou> that 's right <eou> i 'm i 'm not for killing anyone <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do n't want these people around at the same time <eou> we want a safe environment for ourselves <eou> we want to remove them <eou> exactly <eou> i think that the whole crux of the problem is no one has come up with a solution that is acceptable that does basically <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> i think that the whole idea of the death penalty was invented for two reasons <eou> it removes them from society <eou> right <eou> you want to appease the people that have suffered <eou> right <eou> it really does n't take their pain away <eou> uh-huh <eou> at the same time like you said it drains society <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's a <eou> we <eou> i think we should be <eou> we <eou> the same money that we 're using to build more prisons and make more prison space and keep these people in prison that same money or half of that money could be used towards rehabilitation programs of some sort <eou> something to put these people back in society <eou> right <eou> prepare them first <eou> exactly <eou> that <eou> the problem is so incredibly complex <eou> i have a friend who works on the pardon and paroles <eou> she interviews inmates all the time that are coming up for parole <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> she says it is just really frightening how easy it is to have the prisons release people because they 're overcrowded <eou> exactly <eou> these people have not benefited from the stay there <eou> she says just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong <eou> uh-huh <eou> there 's not anything she can do to keep them in if they meet certain guidelines <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work <eou> it 's <eou> uh-huh <eou> you want people out of prison <eou> you want people to get jobs and live happy lives <eou> uh-huh <eou> they ca n't just walk out of prison and do that <eou> they ca n't just walk out of prison and say i 'm going to go a different route <eou> that 's right <eou> that 's right <eou> there has to be some sort of buffer in there <eou> uh-huh <eou> some sort of program or <eou> i know this costs money <eou> it could n't cost any more money than we 're already spending <eou> i know <eou> i know <eou> i would like to see the money that 's been budgeted for new prisons being put into the research of alternate solutions to the problem <eou> uh-huh <eou> how are we going to fix that tanya <eou> how are we going to make that happen <eou> how <eou> what can we do <eou> what power do we have <eou> goodness <eou> everyone 's trying to make it in their own little world <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'm trying to make it with my job and make myself okay and make my family okay <eou> that 's right <eou> it 's so hard to try and be one of the movers and shakers i guess you would call them <eou> really <eou> i know <eou> i know <eou> uh-huh <eou> it sounds like you are interested in what 's going on around you <eou> uh-huh <eou> yes <eou> when you have a voice you do contribute <eou> i guess that 's what we 're meant to do <eou> right <eou> maybe an opportunity will come by that we will have a chance to make a real change <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'm a broadcast journalist <eou> i feel like one day i probably will write a book or something <eou> some of these views will be able to come out <eou> where do you work <eou> i work at channel six here <eou> i 'm a news reporter <eou> you do <eou> that 's great <eou> i guess i 'm pretty emotional about crime things like that now <eou> i 've only been in it for a year <eou> i get to see pretty much close up a lot of things that happen that people do n't see <eou> uh-huh <eou> i get to see a lot of crimes <eou> exactly <eou> i get to see people 's pain and things <eou> when we talk about <eou> uh-huh <eou> most of us are so sheltered <eou> yeah <eou> a few people in the news that bring it to us and make us see what 's out there <eou> exactly <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's <eou> you 're really performing a benefit to society in doing that <eou> a service <eou> yeah <eou> still we ca n't <eou> i do n't know <eou> i guess i would like to probably editorialize more <eou> we have to just report what 's happening <eou> we ca n't say this is what i think about the situation <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> sometimes you really want to say that <eou> you really want to say what you think should be done or how you think this court case should have gone <eou> that 's a <eou> i 'm just i 'm just agreeing with you when i think of it how difficult it must be to just to just give the facts because usually on an issue that you really care about you want to persuade people to your viewpoint <eou> uh-huh <eou> you 're right <eou> that has got to be a challenge sometimes <eou> especially when you are dealing with a subject like capital punishment or something or abortion or something where there 's an no or yes side <eou> right <eou> you have your side <eou> uh-huh <eou> you have to report both sides <eou> right <eou> you really do n't want to because you have your side <eou> you have to walk right down the middle with it <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> sometimes that 's hard <eou> i 'm sure <eou> that sounds interesting <eou> i 'll read your book sometime <eou> that 's good <eou> all right <eou> it was nice talking to you <eou> i enjoyed it <eou> okay <eou> thanks for calling <eou> okay <eou> bye bye <eou>

got to do that <eou> i have also been to the carribean <eou> i have n't been there either <eou> you name it i have n't been there <eou> i have been there a couple of times <eou> uh-huh <eou> i went on a cruise <eou> that is nice <eou> the last time i went i went with my two sisters <eou> uh-huh <eou> it was over christmas time <eou> yeah <eou> we really had a good time <eou> uh-huh <eou> they had this cruise director dress up like santa claus <eou> we went to the beach <eou> they had put a christmas tree on the beach decorated it up <eou> uh-huh <eou> it was a lot of fun <eou> that 's nice <eou> is a cruise nicer than if you just go to a hotel <eou> yeah <eou> it is <eou> i have heard it is <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> you do n't have to worry about unpacking or anything like that <eou> you put your clothes in your room <eou> uh-huh <eou> you will have to go on one <eou> you do n't get seasick <eou> that is what i am afraid of <eou> no <eou> no <eou> there was <eou> some people did on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in <eou> uh-huh <eou> that is unusual <eou> yeah <eou> one of my sisters got sick <eou> the other one did n't <eou> uh-huh <eou> it is really nice <eou> they just do so many things for you to make you enjoy the trip and everything <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> you will have to do that once <eou> i want to go on another one <eou> i want to go to alaska <eou> yes <eou> someone i know was on a cruise to alaska <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> was it to alaska <eou> yeah <eou> i am pretty sure <eou> that is right my hairdresser <eou> really <eou> she went last year <eou> she said she went on a cruise <eou> i was thinking cruise i am thinking <eou> on <eou> she is laying on the beach <eou> i said you are not very tan for someone who has been on a cruise <eou> she said we went to alaska <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> that i would like to go <eou> hawaii is number one <eou> i would also like to go to australia <eou> get a <eou> i think i would like to too <eou> yeah <eou> i keep hoping to win the lottery where i can do all these things <eou> i am just in the publisher 's clearing house and the reader 's digest because we do n't { f uh <eou> } right now the lottery here <eou>
tell me about changes from say twenty years ago since you were an adult twenty years ago <eou> let 's see we assume i was an adult twenty years ago <eou> you 're able to you 're able to vote and go to war and things like that <eou> yeah <eou> definitely able to go to war twenty years ago but not vote <eou> that 's right <eou> that 's one of the changes <eou> not vote <eou> that was one of the changes that came about in the last twenty years <eou> yeah <eou> twenty years ago is nineteen seventy <eou> nineteen seventy i had been married two years <eou> uh-huh <eou> we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixty-eight <eou> uh-huh <eou> around here on the east coast we were heavy into affirmative action <eou> uh-huh <eou> yes <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> the problem was that my hair was too long <eou> uh-huh <eou> you were n't allowed to have a mustache or a beard if you wanted to get ahead with the company <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> if you were a black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months <eou> if you were white male you 're talking six years <eou> huh <eou> that 's basically where i ended up <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> is the company now well represented demographically at the higher echelons <eou> did it work <eou> i think so <eou> i i i stopped working for them in seventy-eight seventy-nine <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's <eou> i think they 're like all companies well represented <eou> uh-huh <eou> everything seems to be fine <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 've kind of lost touch with the company <eou> we had a falling out <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> as far as their management goes i 'm not sure they 're any better off than they were before management wise <eou> uh-huh <eou> other changes just people seem to be more outspoken now individually rather than collectively <eou> uh-huh <eou> back in the seventies we had a lot of protests against the war and bring our troops home <eou> things were more organized <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 've noticed that now more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm not sure if that was because eighties was the me decade <eou> the me decade <eou> uh-huh <eou> everybody was into me <eou> we are getting back into us <eou> it it 's <eou> i 've seen a great deal of change as far as corporate responsibility and things <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> people 's response to that at first not trusting and now expecting more <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> what about the last ten years that you 've been aware <eou> that i 've been aware of i 've <eou> at least in my own circles i 've been aware of an increasing from my generation <eou> i do n't know if i can quite call myself a distinct generation from you <eou> half generation off i guess <eou> i 've noticed a certain increase pessimism with america no longer being sort of on top <eou> i had the impression <eou> there was the quote unquote losing of the vietnam war which was a blow <eou> it was right around that time when i started becoming a socially conscious adult <eou> i realize that people of my age have no major success in the sense that you saw the passage of the civil rights act and major social change in that sense <eou> i <eou> all the changes that have happened in the last even during my adulthood have been more incremental <eou> they 've been continual perhaps and good gains have been made <eou> there has n't been the same sort of fiery speeches of martin luther king or whatever that has really galvanized the population <eou> there 's just <eou> instead there 's been sort of an increasing i do n't know japan bashing and things like that <eou> uh-huh <eou> a lot of <eou> i see among some of my friends and even more among some of my students who are maybe twenty a real sense of america 's losing it <eou> yes <eou> losing it in the competitive market <eou> a real knowl- <eou> a lack of understanding how that could be in the sense that how could america have gone from being number one to possibly being number two <eou> to <eou> our former enemies and things like that <eou> i see a lot of pessimism growing <eou> at the same time i think there 's there 's a growing environmentalist movement and sense of corporate respon- increased corporate responsible towards environmental safety and things like that <eou> that might potentially be sort of the civil right the equivalent of the civil rights act in the near future in terms of some real landmark bills passing and things like that <eou> such that people <eou> the thing about civil rights is people take it for granted now <eou> my generation ca n't rest on the glow of having achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that there 's still some racism <eou> basically things are <eou> the assumption things are basically kind of taken care of <eou> there 's a notion of fairness <eou> yes <eou> that 's <eou> while still far from perfect is much more established i think <eou> even i think along the line of the goals of civil rights there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone <eou> uh-huh <eou> of course <eou> it 's human nature <eou> do n't like the way you look do n't like the way you dress do n't like your hair do n't like it 's just something that always sets people off <eou> you like someone you do n't like someone you 're just completely indifferent <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> the problem is that ideally the world would like you to be completely indifferent <eou> i i understand what you say about the environmental movement <eou> it 's been a long time coming <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i just <eou> i 've seen a lot of changes from the original earth day <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'm heavily involved in my own personal recycling <eou> we recycle paper and cans here at work <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and all that stuff at home <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'm starting to see more and more recycling centers cropping up all over the place here on the east coast <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> that 's a real change except it sort of brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything else <eou> yeah <eou> like <eou> all this recycling used to be in tact * [ [ typo in tact should be 'intact ' or not all of it <eou> yeah <eou> much of it did <eou> recycling was a wartime thing <eou> they turned around and called them junkyards and started making profits off them after the war <eou> yes <eou> yes <eou> now we got to the point where the junkyards you 've got to pay them to take something there <eou> uh-huh <eou> things have really changed a lot <eou> i think the other part about america 's decline i think has to do with <eou> a perceived decline anyway yeah <eou> yeah <eou> the perceived decline has to do with the attitudes and the educational system <eou> in i have three children in school right now <eou> i 'm not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them <eou> i had <eou> when i was down in dallas for two years i had my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong and words spelled wrong not marked as such <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> this person 's teaching my children <eou> uh-huh <eou> i had a real problem with that <eou> yeah <eou> i 'd say as someone who 's involved in education i 'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society <eou> relative pay which is a major way we value people has been poorer and poorer over the years <eou> that <eou> there 's been cost of living increases <eou> not quite in proportion to cost of living <eou> it 's just more and more a real low income sort of job and very low prestige <eou> there 's that old saying those who can do it and those who ca n't teach <eou> this is the way of let 's make fun of the teachers those are the people who ca n't do anything <eou> yeah <eou> if you have that kind of social attitude it 's hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay work for low social prestige just because they care about good education <eou> yeah <eou> you get more and more people and up there because it 's the safety net of those of average intelligence or something they can always teach <eou> i 'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in maryland <eou> they 're trying to get a a merit system here in maryland rather than a tenure system <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou>
yes <eou> i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for puerto rico <eou> i was a resident although very young of what is now the state of alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when alaska stopped being a territory and became a state <eou> i guess i have a left over positive feeling about the question even though i do n't know very much about puerto rico <eou> i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in alaska have been very positive <eou> i have a suspicion that i believe that the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of puerto rico one ought to make it a full-fledged state let it go one or the other <eou> what is your situation <eou> i guess i do n't have such close experience with an area becoming a state as you do <eou> my concern is the economy because as i understand it puerto rico has a very low standard of living or at least annual average income <eou> part of this i suppose is justified in that the climate they do n't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need <eou> however in that case i guess i would favor status quo <eou> i have been to puerto rico and found it very very interesting <eou> i did peace corps training there <eou> that 's very interesting <eou> i saw it also as a young student <eou> it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in california <eou> the spanish was no problem <eou> it was very lovely <eou> the people seemed very friendly and nice <eou> i have <eou> i work with a girl from puerto rico <eou> i guess i have never thought to ask her what she favors <eou> your concern on the economy was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on puerto rico or pressures on the u s in terms of aid <eou> probably more in terms of the u s <eou> i 'm not quite sure how the u s copes with this sort of thing <eou> i 've live abroad most of my life <eou> i guess i 've been very cut off <eou> i lived actually in lebanon <eou> i was very cut off from the press as i was becoming an adult <eou> i do n't know how the u s would cope with a new state that is so very very poor <eou> uh-huh <eou> i guess we 'd have a lot of aid if you consider the inner cities of new york and how much aid it needs <eou> i suppose the whole new state would require such aid <eou> i guess we 're assuming that puerto rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than mississippi <eou> i think so <eou> okay <eou> that 's something that i guess i have not much of an image of other than puerto rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess <eou> although i 'm aware of the political problems and unrest and also difficulties they have i do n't know whether statehood would improve their economy <eou> i do n't know that the act of being a state would have any impact on them <eou> i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they do n't have now <eou> of course if their economy is weak there is not much of a base on which to tax <eou> i do n't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being since they are n't a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they are n't able to tax like a typical state would be <eou> how do you feel though about <eou> i guess it 's to their advantage to be a territory <eou> i wonder how having been in a territory but only as a young student <eou> my parents were in the military at the time <eou> they did n't have ready negative feelings about being in alaska at the time since they voted absentee <eou> i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a feeling of second class citizenry to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote <eou> the district of columbia people for instance are quite frustrated i think at times in their not having a senate representative <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> those are good points which obviously i had never thought about <eou> i do n't know i suppose they also not being a state are probably freer to determine their own ways of life than they would if <eou> i 'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory <eou> uh-huh <eou> i see what you mean <eou> that <eou> yeah <eou> taxes would undoubtedly be occurring <eou> there <eou> i do n't know i do n't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation <eou> frequently the laws in a territory are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states <eou> i <eou> i 'm thinking in terms of education <eou> then again each state sets its own <eou> i do n't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like puerto rico <eou> it 's interesting because i have n't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to economy i had thought of it more in terms of political realization <eou> i guess i had automatically made the assumption that anyone would rather be a state of the u s than an independent country <eou> uh-huh <eou> i thin- <eou> one one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they 've recently voted that spanish is the official language which i always assumed it was anyway <eou> if they 've just taken such action it would seem to indicate to me they 're doing it because they 're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state maybe because they do n't want to become a state for fear of losing the spanish or hispanic heritage <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's interesting too <eou> it sounds as though you are in favor of status quo <eou> i believe i would probably tend towards that <eou> i think having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these <eou> [ i 'm ul- i guess i 'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point towards the statehood <eou> that 's interesting <eou> right <eou> what about if they demanded to have spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood <eou> i think i would be troubled <eou> i believe that any of our states <eou> i <eou> constitutionally i do n't think there are any prescriptions against that decision even if louisiana chose to go with creole or something <eou> i do n't think there is any prohibitions <eou> i would be bothered by that <eou> i 'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of america 's strengths <eou> that 's the the melting pot <eou> uh-huh <eou> i am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines <eou> i 'm troubled by too close a clinging to the past <eou> i 'm also realizing that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country <eou> uh-huh <eou> canada i guess comes to my mind as they 're going through the throes up there relative to french quebec and whatever <eou> that i think that would be a negative step to make <eou> i think that that they would need to reassess that <eou> i 'm troubled even in by bilingualism in so far that it gets in the way of of the melting pot aspect <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's interesting because although i tend to be bilingual spanish based on experience i was in bilingual education in california <eou> i did n't have any problem with my students <eou> i noticed my brother who was quite a bit younger was learning spanish in elementary school <eou> he ca n't speak a word <eou> obviously it did n't work in california <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm rather in favor of people being bilingual <eou> right <eou> i 'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn english and a second language <eou> right <eou> i 'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level <eou> i see <eou> i 'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think we have gone to time <eou> i appreciate your having called <eou> okay <eou> thank you very much <eou> good-bye <eou> bye <eou> bye <eou>
what kind of house do you live in <eou> we live in a one story just like a style home the standard texas fox and jacobs <eou> yeah with a yard and fence <eou> how about you guys <eou> are you in a apartment or a home <eou> i 'm in an apartment in plano <eou> they say those are difficult to find <eou> yeah <eou> they are if <eou> kind of depends on what you 're looking for <eou> mine 's just a one bedroom place <eou> that 's <eou> how are rents doing <eou> i have n't looked at rents in a long time <eou> it 's hard for me to tell because i have n't rented in probably twenty twenty-five years <eou> uh-huh <eou> just <eou> i 'm getting back into apartment life <eou> it 's <eou> what 's a one bedroom <eou> are you in a <eou> yeah <eou> plano <eou> most complexes in plano are pretty nice <eou> you 're probably in a <eou> they vary from place to place <eou> it 's hard to tell how well they 've been kept up how old they are <eou> uh-huh that does get high <eou> these are probably one of the nicest that i found <eou> they 're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it does considering that house payments are not a whole lot more than that <eou> yeah <eou> i was going to say our mortgage is between depending on <eou> it drops <eou> seems like in the last six months we got lucky <eou> we refinanced <eou> it <eou> it was like eight hundred and something <eou> it went down to like seven hundred and twenty <eou> yeah <eou> that 's really not <eou> i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a town house in <eou> that 's a lot for a townhouse <eou> yeah <eou> in <eou> they 're near plano in north dallas too <eou> i could n't believe it <eou> that 's what happens when you get up in this area you got all these companies are up here <eou> these <eou> yeah <eou> i guess they know they 're going to get it <eou> i think that nobody was really buying houses there for a long time there because of just <eou> we 've been in ours for about ten years <eou> there 's no investment in it all it allows you to do is itemize on your taxes yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true <eou> you just take off your mortgage interest <eou> that 's about it <eou> that 's really about it <eou> it 's <eou> have you ever owned your own home <eou> yeah <eou> i 've owned several built several <eou> you know what it 's like <eou> yeah <eou> it 's like when you first <eou> this is our third one <eou> it 's not <eou> it 's not that exciting after a while <eou> especially around north dallas or at least in plano area they basically all look alike because fox and jacobs <eou> yeah <eou> suburban tract <eou> yeah <eou> we lived out of state for a while and came back <eou> we lived in a smaller city <eou> now we say dallas really is big and polluted <eou> is n't it <eou> i can remember <eou> i 've only been here eight years <eou> i can remember coming to work from <eou> i used to live in wylie <eou> uh-huh <eou> i could see downtown dallas <eou> now there 's this brown haze over it it 's moving north <eou> yeah it 's really sad because they 're not doing anything <eou> we 're getting off the subject i guess <eou> just like with housing they 're not doing anything about pollution <eou> they 're not doing anything about <eou> it 's going to look like <eou> have you ever been to houston <eou> yeah <eou> i used to think that dallas was better than houston because their zoning for where you can put a house next to a <eou> yeah <eou> now it looks just like houston to me <eou> yeah <eou> it does <eou> how long have you been in this house <eou> we 've been in here ten years <eou> ten years <eou> yeah <eou> we 've got some investment in it <eou> you really do n't get anything out of it <eou> no <eou> you really do n't <eou> you said you were out of state for a while was that a smaller town than dallas area <eou> yeah <eou> smaller <eou> we were up in pittsburgh pennsylvania <eou> how was it <eou> my home town <eou> how were the house prices up there <eou> the prices a lot better because pittsburgh is about the size like a louisville or minneapolis that type of size <eou> yeah <eou> the prices what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy-five eighty <eou> wow <eou> yeah <eou> it 's really <eou> we did n't think it was that clean <eou> after you 're gone for a while it looks cleaner <eou> yeah <eou> a lot of these people that i 've talked to that are coming down from what i call the back east especially from j c penney are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy-five thousand dollar houses down here <eou> yeah <eou> they 've wound up getting better houses here than they had there <eou> in a way i guess it works both ways <eou> i guess it 's <eou> yeah <eou> here i guess it depends on what you want <eou> here i got a lot of people that work for j c penney in marketing <eou> yeah <eou> a lot of the people that came from that area probably like what you 're talking about they had a lot of property but not a lot of house <eou> now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it <eou> that 's a fact <eou> they love it <eou> they they think they 're getting <eou> you say sun room to them and you enclose and you can sell it <eou> i guess that 's true <eou> yeah <eou> they do n't have to worry about yard upkeep if they do n't hardly have any <eou> yeah <eou> a lot of them i know a couple women that work there <eou> they do n't miss in public relations <eou> they do n't miss having a basement to run up and down to <eou> that 's true <eou> not too many basements in texas <eou> i said you have n't heard about tornados <eou> how about those <eou> yeah <eou> i remember when i was little we did n't have a <eou> i grew up in southern oklahoma <eou> uh-huh <eou> people across the street had a cellar <eou> we never did <eou> it 's just like dallas area it was tornado alley up there <eou> every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street <eou> we 'd go into the cellar <eou> i to this day i do n't care if i go or not <eou> yep <eou> if it 's going to get me it 's get me <eou> that 's exactly <eou> growing <eou> i grew up in western pennsylvania near pittsburgh <eou> we used to call the basements actual cellars <eou> it 's funny to hear that word because i never hear it <eou> it 's like the back porch used to be a stoop <eou> yeah <eou> the housing is just <eou> we like the older houses <eou> i do n't know if we 're going to stay here or not depends <eou> you ever thought about building a house <eou> pardon me <eou> have you ever thought about building a house <eou> yeah <eou> when we were up north <eou> some family things changed <eou> we ended up come back down here and all that because it helped my husband 's work <eou> we really would like to <eou> we do n't know if we 're going to do it unless we stay here <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true <eou> especially when <eou> with t i it 's like anybody else you never know how long you 're going to be in one place <eou> yeah <eou> it 's real tough <eou> the economy any more <eou> i think everybody just lives under an umbrella the uncertainty with housing and everything <eou> yeah <eou> it 's <eou> do you work <eou> pardon me <eou> do you work <eou> yes <eou> i do <eou> how do you handle <eou> do you have kids <eou> no <eou> we do n't <eou> you got <eou> he 's working and working to get this big house to take care of <eou> how do you manage both of those <eou> how do we take care of the house <eou> i do n't have a mexi- <eou> i should n't say that <eou> i do n't have an ethnic maid <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't have <eou> we have some friends that live near north dallas off of campbell road <eou> they have like a four thousand square foot home <eou> she 's got a live out nanny <eou> any rate i do n't have any of that <eou> i do n't know <eou> it 's really not too difficult with no children and just two people <eou> you basically can take care of everything yourself <eou> we have a <eou> yeah <eou> we have a dog <eou> we 're pretty <eou> we 're not fanatically neat <eou> we keep things up not like where there is three feet of weeds or anything in the yard by the time you need to get around to fertilizing and cutting in the spring <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> what about home repairs and stuff <eou> do you have to do all that yourself <eou> no <eou> we 're pretty much <eou> we 've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wall paper together and things like that <eou> you too <eou> we pretty much hire <eou> we subcontract mostly everything other than anything that 's not a <eou> yeah <eou> i know how to fix a running toilet <eou> yeah <eou> he does what he needs to <eou> mostly if it 's something major cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that we just hire out to do that <eou> sounds like you 've already got the makings for being a general contractor <eou> yeah <eou> no thanks <eou> i <eou> if you do n't wall paper it well together you should probably not build a house together <eou> have you ever done that <eou> yeah <eou> i built three houses in my life <eou> how 'd that go <eou> the building process was a lot of fun <eou> uh-huh <eou> puts a lot of strain on things <eou> getting to agree to things i 'm sure <eou> i also think that once you get to be certain <eou> when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older you start <eou> yeah <eou> the dollar value on things i <eou> you bet <eou> i think people that own homes a lot in north dallas are very materialistic <eou> you bet <eou> i know i 'm supposed to talk about homes <eou> the people that own them are the homes themselves <eou> spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies for custom drapes just does n't <eou> yeah <eou> to some of them i guess it does n't matter that maybe they 've got enough coming in to take care of it <eou> yeah <eou> that 's <eou> you see a lot of these people that came west from new york with exxon or j c penney <eou> it 's just a hoot to watch them <eou> are they <eou> as far as they 're concerned they 've come to the promised land <eou> they 've got it made <eou> right <eou> right <eou> exactly <eou> was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house <eou> yeah <eou> you 're confined by space <eou> i had a <eou> i came out of a thirty-one hundred square foot two story house <eou> my goodness <eou> yeah <eou> i had room for everything <eou> in fact i had more room than knew what to do with <eou> i do n't know <eou> uh-huh <eou> just seems like stuff always expands to fill available space <eou> yeah <eou> in a way you can travel light <eou> you can <eou> you lear- you adjust you figure out <eou> how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that <eou> it 's not as bad as i thought it was <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's not as bad as i remembered especially going to college and living in apartments there you know how noisy that can be <eou> yes <eou> i do <eou> there seems to be more a mature crowd in apartments at least where i am even though there 's kids all around <eou> there 's traffic <eou> there 's people running up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that <eou> still <eou> everybody pretty much keeps- keeps to their own turf so to speak <eou> yeah <eou> pretty much <eou> there 's never really any <eou> i remember in school <eou> there 's just <eou> seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night <eou> yeah <eou> you do n't run into that up here i think because there 's so many professional people if you want to call them that that go spend all day at work <eou> uh-huh <eou> they want to come home <eou> they want some quiet <eou> relax and try to go to sleep <eou> really <eou> yeah <eou> you see a lot of activity outside people riding bikes playing ball or jogging <eou> they 're doing this and that <eou> they 're trying to unwind <eou> i think plano in general is getting a little more <eou> it 's gotten so big it 's almost a town in it 's own right <eou> yeah <eou> it 's a hundred and what eighty thousand something like that <eou> something <eou> yeah <eou> the price of home <eou> we paid about seventy-eight nine for our house like i said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago <eou> i 'd say they appraised it <eou> gone up maybe like five percent <eou> yeah <eou> it 's an investment <eou> it 's something that <eou> when you 're first married or starting out you think if you really have something <eou> you really <eou> it 's just real <eou> nowadays with the way the income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize <eou> you bet <eou> the thing that gets me is you never really catch up you never really finish doing things you 're always paying for something <eou> yeah <eou> exactly <eou> we <eou> yeah <eou> even <eou> we had i called them prefabs just a tract home <eou> we had one of their homes that was nicer in pennsylvania <eou> it was an older home <eou> you buy an older home and you 're always fixing things up <eou> you are constantly <eou> there 's always something going wrong <eou>
okay <eou> great <eou> currently i 'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program <eou> huh-uh <eou> i 'm mainly do a lot of walking <eou> i have a son that 's a little bit overweight <eou> the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around <eou> my wife and i kind of take turns <eou> at one time i had a fairly regular exercise program <eou> in the last couple of months i 've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down <eou> all this space that normally would be dedicated towards the exercise area is covered in boxes <eou> yeah <eou> what did you do when you did exercise regularly <eou> i had a little routine that i did for warm ups <eou> huh-uh <eou> i did some very mild light weight lifting <eou> nothing <eou> i 'm not trying to make big bulging muscles just trying to try and stay as firm as i can stay in my old age <eou> huh-uh <eou> yeah <eou> right now i try when it 's nice out <eou> it 's been raining a lot this spring <eou> i try to <eou> i have a bicycle <eou> i like to cycle a lot <eou> my husband and i we have entered a few rallies that 's pretty popular in texas <eou> i do n't know if it 's up north <eou> huh-uh <eou> every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally <eou> thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles which that 's a lot of fun <eou> huh-uh <eou> we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that <eou> t i where i work has a fitness center <eou> a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends we 'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill <eou> they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine that are fun to ride and workout on <eou> i try to <eou> i 'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis <eou> i used to get into it and get out of it based on my schedule <eou> i 'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now <eou> it 's a big commitment <eou> we do n't have any kids yet <eou> that 's a part of it <eou> yeah <eou> that 's a plus <eou> i have a total of five children <eou> i have three left living at home <eou> huh-uh <eou> they do take up a big part of my evening and weekend <eou> yeah <eou> it 's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself too <eou> yeah <eou> it 's something they do n't tell you about when you 're growing up <eou> when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children <eou> huh-uh <eou> that 's why at t i they really stress staying in shape stay in overall fitness no smoking and all that <eou> it 's hard to find an actual exercise regimen that work for you because i know a lot of people that cycle they take their kids behind them on the bikes <eou> i do n't know if that would work for me because i do n't know i would n't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain <eou> it 's really hard to find something that works and to find time to do it and stay committed to it three days a week or whatever <eou> i think maybe walking or running would probably work because it does n't take much time and much money or whatever <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> you have to <eou> what i found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself <eou> huh-uh <eou> you can use what ever rationale you want <eou> basically the healthier you stay the longer you 'll live <eou> right <eou> if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer then i 'll around a lot longer <eou> those people that i 'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now get the enjoyment of me years past where i would have been if i would n't have taken it <eou> huh-uh <eou> if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine <eou> yeah <eou> i 've been learning a lot lately about <eou> i 've been reading a book by kenneth cooper <eou> i do n't know if you 're familiar with him <eou> huh-uh <eou> he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health <eou> he 's kind of he 's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing <eou> he was talking about the three things that cause aging smoking are inactivity * [ [ mistranscribed listen <eou> what was the other one i think was obesity <eou> if you can control those three areas then are you going to live longer cause those are risk factors it 's kind of a tip <eou> yeah <eou> i 've done a lot of study over the years <eou> i found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water <eou> really <eou> yeah <eou> the research that i 've done <eou> i 've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three <eou> huh-uh <eou> it 's amazing that prior to nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks <eou> huh-uh <eou> there were none prior to nineteen-hundred <eou> in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities <eou> after that we started having the hearts attacks <eou> dr price wrote a book coronary cholesterol and chlorine <eou> you can usually find it in a health food store <eou> huh-uh <eou> i know they had it in health food stores in plano <eou> i used live in plano <eou> dr price <eou> dr price <eou> yeah <eou> it 's amazing <eou> he makes the <eou> it 's a very small book <eou> the guys very opinionated <eou> he makes a very good case against chlorine <eou> there were no heart attacks before we started using it <eou> he points out that people in england <eou> even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we 're ingesting now <eou> they were n't dropping dead of heart attacks <eou> yeah <eou> he did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours and proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis which is the clogging of the arteries <eou> huh-uh <eou> yeah <eou> he 's <eou> there 's been a lot of reports since then <eou> this whole thing about <eou> first it was stress then it went to cholesterol <eou> now they 're saying what 's cholesterol <eou> there 's good cholesterol and there 's bad cholesterol <eou> huh-uh <eou> it 's amazing what he points out in that book <eou> in fact everyone there was a toxicologist for the environmental protection agency who did work back in nineteen eighty-six who wrote a letter to dr price in nineteen eighty-seven in this letter he praised dr price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that e p a had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis <eou> e p a never published that report <eou> what 's the name of this book again <eou> coronary cholesterol and chlorine <eou> i 'll have to remember that <eou> yeah <eou> that will be very interesting <eou> my husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon <eou> he 's really interested in the heart <eou> yeah <eou> in fact he 's a heart too <eou> he 's done a lot of research on how your heart reacts to exercise <eou> sorry <eou> he made me laugh <eou> yeah <eou> there is a lot of good information out there about health <eou> a lot of the myths they 've been passing around people are starting to realize are n't true <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that because that 's good for you <eou> huh-uh <eou> to believe some of the things <eou> i do n't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet <eou> to think that solely alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is just hard to believe <eou> if you get a chance read dr cooper 's book on controlling cholesterol <eou> huh-uh <eou> that 's a real good <eou> he talks about that <eou> talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that <eou> yeah <eou> i actually eat pretty much anything that i want <eou> huh-uh <eou> i 've had my cholesterol checked a few times <eou> i 've never been above one-hundred and fifty never <eou> huh-uh <eou> i <eou> you have a good ratio of good to bad cholesterol <eou> everything is within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing <eou> they leave themselves wide open so they ca n't be sued <eou> yeah <eou> we 've <eou> i work at the t i site in hunt valley maryland <eou> really <eou> yeah <eou> we 've had a few of the health fairs up here <eou> i 've always come out aces <eou> that 's good <eou> i 'm not really that big on watching what i eat <eou> i do eat some health cookies that are high in fiber low in fat and all that kind of stuff <eou> yeah <eou> i mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine i 'm not worried about it <eou>
i personally do n't have any problem with drug testing employees or potential employees do you <eou> basically <eou> basically no <eou> okay <eou> i do n't <eou> i really ca n't disagree with it <eou> i <eou> the policy that t i has i think is very fair <eou> uh-huh <eou> i <eou> they first had a policy where they would test new employees <eou> since i 've been with them the last four years there 's been in the last year year and a half they 're doing random testing of all employees <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think that 's really the only fair way to do it <eou> yes <eou> i really think it ought to be s- <eou> junkins all the way down <eou> it is <eou> it <eou> from what i understand it is jerry junkins all the way down <eou> right <eou> as a matter of fact i want to think they took the top managers first <eou> is n't that a fact <eou> i 've been retired from t i about a year <eou> uh-huh <eou> the program was still fairly new <eou> i guess it had been going on maybe almost a year before i retired <eou> uh-huh <eou> i was not ever called upon to do a drug test <eou> i certainly would n't object to it <eou> i think random is probably the only really fair way to do it <eou> yeah <eou> i like it because <eou> i i grew up in the sixties i saw <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i know my friends who were druggies and friends who were n't i think it 's a real problem <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i <eou> absolutely <eou> i think it 's causing us a lot of trouble and a lot of problems <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'm hoping that a lot of other companies will follow the same path <eou> i do n't think they 'll have much choice do you <eou> probably not <eou> especially if they have anything do with government contracts or anything <eou> as matter of fact i want to believe that the defense department more or less mandated that people who work on defense contracts do some sort of drug testing <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think that 's really what maybe prompted t i to do it <eou> i was in the defense electronic division when i retired <eou> i know it was a real hot hot item there <eou> i want to think maybe they really got some nudging from d o d to do this sort of thing <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> you know the atmosphere then <eou> yep <eou> yeah <eou> very aware of it like school systems and that kind of thing <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> i agree <eou> i <eou> i 'd like to know that my child 's being taught by a teacher who 's not on drugs or who might be at a point where they 're trying to sell my kid drugs <eou> that 's right <eou> that 's r- <eou> absolutely <eou> yeah <eou> i d- <eou> i just ca n't disagree the basic premise <eou> yeah <eou> it 's to m- <eou> as far as i know it 's seems to be a fairly accurate program as far as the testing goes <eou> i like the idea that they have a system where they allow you to be retested if for some reason there may have been a problem or something did show up <eou> that 's right <eou> that 's right <eou> offer you help if you need help <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> rather than just put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself <eou> yeah <eou> that 's right <eou> that 's not going to help anybody get over the problem <eou> no <eou> ab- <eou> i believe it is a a medical problem <eou> that 's right <eou> of course i also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world too <eou> absolutely <eou> not to mention alcohol <eou> yeah <eou> there 's a lot of things out there <eou> yep <eou> yep <eou> i 'm just glad that they decided not to tax drugs otherwise they 'd be legal <eou> uh-huh <eou> they 'd be getting tax money off it the same way they are the alcohol and tobacco <eou> that 's right <eou> that 's right <eou> gosh <eou> it 's a real problem <eou> i 'm sure <eou> i 'm sure <eou> yeah <eou> i have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy and stuff <eou> uh-huh <eou> i moved to a t i facility that had never had random drug sampling before because they were outside of the military sector <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> uh-huh <eou> it was an industrial company that t i purchased <eou> the people here a lot of them are real opposed to it <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> they were really opposed to it <eou> uh-huh <eou> there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's why they were opposed to it <eou> right <eou> it resulted in a few people leaving because they just flat out were n't going to put up with the policy <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> they had a life-style <eou> they were n't going to change it <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> it 's <eou> yeah <eou> i know a lot of people who when it first be- <eou> at least began was in the talking sta- <eou> everybody knew it was coming <eou> it just a matter of time everybody was screaming invasion of privacy and all this stuff <eou> a lot of people i think after they thought about it for awhile weighed the pros and cons decided it 's really not a bad idea unless you 're doing drugs of course <eou> yeah <eou> you should have no objection to it <eou> it 's like going down to get your license and checking your eyes <eou> that 's right <eou> why do i need my eyes checked <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's right <eou> yep <eou> yep <eou> you know it 's why are we doing this <eou> so you do n't kill people on the road <eou> that 's right <eou> or yourself <eou> it 's a ba- <eou> it 's the basic premise with drug testing <eou> yeah <eou> that 's right <eou> especially some of the jobs <eou> luckily i 've always been in the engineering sector <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as hurting someone <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true <eou> in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor and down in some of those labs and stuff if i 'd want somebody down there that i 'm working with side by side that could kill me by doing something incorrectly because they were not exactly all there because they were on drugs <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> assembly people <eou> that 's right <eou> that 's r- <eou> absolutely <eou> there 's a lot of sectors where i think that would would help out <eou> i think in the long run we all benefit <eou> uh-huh <eou> absolutely <eou> yeah <eou> if you have <eou> if you 're not working with someone on drugs then you 're going to have less accidents <eou> uh-huh <eou> you have less accidents <eou> you spend less money on medical <eou> uh-huh <eou> you spend less money on medical then the company 's more profitable <eou> yeah <eou> the company 's more profitable then maybe they can pay you more <eou> sure <eou> if they can pay you more you can buy more <eou> uh-huh <eou> it <eou> it goes around to everywhere <eou> sure <eou> trickles up and down <eou> yep <eou> all over <eou> sure does <eou> yeah <eou> affects a lot of people <eou> it certainly does <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> and and start it up <eou> i think they probably will <eou> if they <eou> i 'm sure it 's a very expensive program to administer <eou> i 'm not sure every small company could do it <eou> a lot of companies are coming down in price <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think that the insurance companies are starting to give benefits <eou> uh-huh <eou> reduction in medical costs if they <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it 's got to help them too <eou> yeah <eou> i think everybody will benefit from the program <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> i do too <eou> that 's right <eou> i think if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say if you impose mandatory drug testing we 'll reduce your insurance costs by twenty per cent <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> of course the company 's not going to reduce the employee 's cost of insurance twenty per cent they 're going to reduce their own <eou> no <eou> no <eou> it 'll save in some areas <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> that 'll cover it <eou> maybe some insurance companies might start offering it as part of the package <eou> that 's right <eou> that certainly could happen <eou> that 's a very very very competitive business <eou> yeah <eou> it <eou> i think i think all around it 's going to help out a lot <eou> yeah <eou> i do too <eou> course <eou> i just really ca n't disagree with you <eou> yeah <eou> okay <eou> it 's nice to talk to you <eou> it was great talking with you <eou> you take care <eou> you do the same <eou> okay <eou> bye-bye <eou> bye-bye <eou>
okay <eou> we can be recorded while we talk about it <eou> okay <eou> is your <eou> does your city have mandatory recycling <eou> no <eou> we do n't have mandatory <eou> we 're kind of slow up here <eou> we 've just started doing recycling probably last summer <eou> it 's all voluntary <eou> that 's interesting <eou> cities have a mandatory recycling <eou> there 're some places that are strongly encouraging it <eou> that they city will pick it up <eou> that 's been one of the arguments here <eou> i 'm just sitting here looking we 've got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff <eou> we have to carry it some distance <eou> some places you can sell your recyclables <eou> for example our church was collecting newspapers <eou> yeah <eou> when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing <eou> we got like a penny a pound for them <eou> it turns out that so much <eou> the problem in texas is that they 've got so much paper now from people recycling that they 've got no way to reprocess it <eou> my <eou> it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it <eou> the value has gone down <eou> it turns out it was n't worth for the church to do <eou> i did n't realize <eou> you would think <eou> now up here i suppose they send it all back to the mill <eou> there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of <eou> there is one in northern vermont <eou> there 's probably a paper mill that 's sixty miles from here <eou> i did n't think that <eou> in the large city that if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away it 's a lot of money to transport <eou> yeah <eou> that 's <eou> in dallas there no plan to build <eou> i think there 's some in east texas there 's some pulp mills <eou> you have to go to houston <eou> it 's interesting <eou> there 's places that will buy metal <eou> they still buy aluminum can and likes that * [ [ can > cans likes > like <eou> do you have to buy metal <eou> copper is a very good one to collect <eou> even aluminum <eou> yeah <eou> do you do recycling <eou> we do the recycling <eou> our city will pick up our recyclables <eou> oh <eou> they have these little blue bins <eou> i do n't recycle personally <eou> i 'm saying i want to do it <eou> i do n't get a lot of magazines <eou> i do n't get a <eou> i do n't buy the newspaper <eou> i do have a lot of <eou> my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of different papers and cardboards <eou> do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans <eou> yes <eou> we have a bottle return <eou> a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles <eou> we 've had five cent deposits on our bottles for years <eou> it 's worth taking them back <eou> we do n't have <eou> we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles <eou> they should definitely get the nickel returnable <eou> it 's great for the kids because <eou> a lot of the kids get the money from it <eou> it 's great for the boy scouts running around they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes <eou> that 's it <eou> you 'll <eou> there is a down side to all this about no good deed going unpunished that my mother sells trees that they make paper out of <eou> every time i recycle newspapers in fact there 's a <eou> kimberly and clark the makers of kleenex and such has a big paper mill <eou> yeah <eou> in fact i almost went to work for them <eou> i was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me <eou> it 's twenty or thirty miles from my house <eou> every time you recycle that 's one less tree my mother can sell <eou> it 's a question should i be diligent and and recycle and put my mother out of her livelihood <eou> and recycle <eou> yes <eou> i see that <eou> it 's an interesting point though that everybody 's so anxious to recycle <eou> i suppose it does provide some gainful employment <eou> it takes away employment from the resource <eou> its <eou> in general i think it 's a good idea because like the glass you ca n't argue that the glass <eou> i do too <eou> it does n't biodegrade and the plastics obviously <eou> they do n't either <eou> we might as well recycle those <eou> yeah <eou> like i say it 's not a very controversial thing <eou> everyone thinks we should do it <eou> it 's just that we 're so lazy <eou> personally i do n't want to clean my <eou> i just have can cat food <eou> i do n't want to clean the can and take the label off it and put it in a separate bin <eou> yeah <eou> i 'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash <eou> that 's what we 've got <eou> we started about new year 's we decided we 'd get ambitious <eou> we took one load over there <eou> now we 've got these containers filling up with stuff <eou> it 's not a very high priority thing to go haul these containers over there <eou> yeah <eou> i think i would be like <eou> when i bring my bottles back if they 're pretty clean and stuff so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months <eou> i get a whole bunch of them and bring them over <eou> if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean like if i washed all the cans and things i would n't mind if it sat around too much <eou> if it stunk or something i would n't like doing it <eou> i produce quite a bit of trash <eou> my house <eou> i see it <eou> i do n't see so much that i can recycle <eou> yeah <eou> like i say it 's a lot of different type paper and cardboard <eou> i 'm not a real plastic person user but a lot of paper pretty much <eou> i do n't know how they sort that <eou> if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles i would think that i would have a recycling center <eou> now it 's just me and my husband <eou> i do n't know <eou> every little bit helps <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> i know what you 're saying <eou> we have a very aggressive recycling at work <eou> i 'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin <eou> some people the recycle bin is on their way out <eou> instead of carrying your newspapers when they get done with them at the end of the day they throw them in the trash <eou> do you have separate trash cans at your desk <eou> no <eou> we do n't <eou> other offices do <eou> they have a box for papers <eou> we have one that 's recyclable and then for lunch sacks and waste food <eou> they gave us a list of things that are n't re- <eou> it turns out it 's not so bad <eou> i get a lot of reports that are covered in plastic or like saran wrap or something { d anyway <eou> } cardboard there 's a few <eou> it 's interesting that we 're recycling computer type paper <eou> yeah <eou> one day they 'll pick up <eou> the cleaning people come through and they 'll pick up recycled paper <eou> the next day they 'll pick up the other <eou> oh <eou> depending on how much <eou> there 's a lot of it works pretty well <eou> we have a waste cans for aluminum in the break areas at work <eou> that 's a really good idea because our fruit juices for some reason when they 're in a can do n't come with a deposit <eou> yeah <eou> they 're thinking about putting a deposit on them because you 're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans where they 're so much easier just to put a deposit on it because probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because they 're beer and soda <eou> yeah <eou> when they sell juice it 's some strange quirk in the law you do n't have to have a deposit on it <eou> even like a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it <eou> if it 's got soda in it it does <eou> it 's a strange <eou> that 's an interesting distinction <eou> yeah <eou> they should clear that up <eou> it would n't take them much to put a stamp on the juice cans as easily as the soda <eou> yeah <eou> redemption centers are a big thing up here <eou> they get a penny a can they handle <eou> they give you five cents when they return the can to the distributor <eou> i think they get a penny two pennies a can <eou> those of us that do n't have state income taxes <eou> yet that 's the big debate here in texas that the legislature wants to put one in <eou> yeah <eou> it 's interesting what people get upset about <eou> it really is <eou> is bottle return down there a heated debate <eou> no <eou> yeah <eou> we <eou> here you ca n't drink <eou> we 're not civilized now you can not drink beer and drive it was actually legal <eou> yes <eou> i know i was in atlanta <eou> you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand <eou> here let me put that in a paper cup for you <eou> that was strange <eou> i think <eou> if some people they have <eou> they say we 're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all the recycle center you have to deal with the can and then you have to recycle it <eou> their problem 's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits see how they handle it <eou> yeah the other thing is it also is a is a good habit to just to conserve resources because you get in the habit of that you think in terms of of of things like saving <eou> see if it 's a good way <eou> do it that way because like i say people are making money on it <eou> the cans are worth something <eou>
are we tonight <eou> yeah <eou> sure <eou> okay <eou> let me go ahead and press one <eou> okay leslie <eou> i 'd like to find out a little bit about your hobbies <eou> what do you like to do in your spare time <eou> when i have my spare time i do enjoy <eou> it 's a cherished commodity now days <eou> that 's right <eou> i do enjoy sewing <eou> i hand <eou> i do some needlepoint <eou> great <eou> i 've been doing a a picture for my father-in-law <eou> if i ever get enough spare time he might see it one day <eou> uh-huh <eou> some other things i like to do are music and also reading <eou> what kind of music <eou> i enjoy singing <eou> okay <eou> yeah <eou> great <eou> i enjoy music too <eou> i <eou> one thing that i like to do is sit down and play the piano <eou> i ca n't play that well <eou> i enjoy that <eou> uh-huh <eou> a couple of hobbies that i also have is <eou> i really enjoy bike riding <eou> the biggest hobbies i have right now are my kids and whatever they are involved in <eou> yes <eou> like my oldest boy is involved in soccer <eou> we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football <eou> we also like to ride bicycles <eou> we 're riding bicycles <eou> a lot of the hobbies that i have right now are centered around my children and also things that my wife and i like to do together <eou> uh-huh <eou> personally a lot of the hobbies i had when i was growing up and going to college and so forth are having to change <eou> uh-huh <eou> i really enjoyed mountain climbing <eou> i really enjoyed skiing and a lot of outdoor activities <eou> there 's not a whole lot of mountains here in texas that i can go skiing with that right now <eou> that 's right <eou> hopefully i will be able to get back to the slopes some day <eou> yeah <eou> i have not had the opportunity to go skiing <eou> i grew up in arizona which has some mountains around it never did get out and ski <eou> uh-huh <eou> you did n't <eou> no <eou> i never did <eou> i guess i did n't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing <eou> of course i was at that stage of my life where i had to be taken to places <eou> i could n't go by myself <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true <eou> that 's true <eou> of course once i got to the age where i could have done it myself i had other interests i guess <eou> yeah <eou> i guess that for me it was very helpful <eou> my two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing <eou> yeah <eou> we went quite often <eou> in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing <eou> when i lived around in that area my brother would fly in from chicago <eou> we would go skiing and enjoy that <eou> uh-huh <eou> luckily it 's kind of unusual because hobbies it 's a nice thing to have <eou> it 's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to like you mentioned <eou> i am finding out a lot of the spare time that i had is n't there <eou> that 's right <eou> it 's taken up by activities with work with family with civic and church responsibilities for me <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> i find if i make i have to make myself realize that it is important to get out there and just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> my youngest daughter is going to be starting up soccer <eou> she 's real excited about doing that <eou> great <eou> we will be busy with that again <eou> what again <eou> you have participated with that in the past <eou> pardon me <eou> have you participated in that in the past <eou> i did with my older daughter <eou> uh-huh <eou> she was in it for a few years <eou> she has got so many interests herself that we had to start eliminating <eou> the first one to go <eou> she still likes her piano <eou> uh-huh <eou> she is in band <eou> she 's got lots of hobbies or activities going on <eou> it sounds like her life is full too <eou> yeah <eou> i imagine your life is full taking them around all over the place <eou> very much <eou> that 's right <eou> that 's right <eou> all right <eou> all right <eou> leslie it 's been very nice talking to you <eou> is there anything else that you would like to mention tonight <eou> no <eou> i think we covered it pretty good <eou> okay <eou> great <eou> thank you for calling <eou> thank you <eou> you have a nice evening <eou> you too <eou> bye <eou> bye <eou> bye now <eou>
what kind of neat hobbies do you have <eou> i like gardening a lot <eou> i like to be outside <eou> i like gardening <eou> i wish i had a green thumb though <eou> i 've got a brown thumb <eou> that 's what everything turns <eou> is <eou> do you keep trying anyway <eou> i keep trying <eou> you just ca n't give up on it <eou> i bought some plants from michigan bulb company <eou> they send them to you all ready alive <eou> no <eou> no <eou> i 've never had any luck with their 's <eou> really <eou> right <eou> i guess these are going to croak too <eou> since i 've got cats i decided to get some catnip <eou> oh <eou> lots and lots of catnip <eou> it 's still green <eou> it 's been two days <eou> i 'm encouraged <eou> no <eou> i have n't had good luck with that company <eou> i think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail probably <eou> yeah <eou> i 've had to get my money back from them and had better luck with some of the more expensive companies <eou> yeah <eou> there 's a <eou> because they <eou> i do n't know <eou> do you have lowe 's up there <eou> its <eou> building contra- <eou> building supplies place <eou> no <eou> they also have a garden shop <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's great <eou> yeah <eou> our local stores do n't offer any guarantee <eou> some of the <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> something like that <eou> i got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff <eou> i 'm going to wait on those <eou> they 're bulbs for spring or fall <eou> probably spring <eou> i do n't much care about things like that <eou> i 'll make a little sort of greenhouse a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in <eou> something to keep me occupied <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'll buy some plastic and make a little house <eou> cute <eou> yeah <eou> watch the cats tear it up <eou> right <eou> i do n't know that <eou> do cats bother bulbs <eou> i think more the mice or other rodents <eou> they just like to get in and dig <eou> i see <eou> if you have fresh dirt they 'll <eou> they love to dig <eou> i had some <eou> i do n't know what kind they are <eou> i 've already forgotten <eou> just regular old flower seeds <eou> i planted them <eou> i was so thrilled because they came up nice green shoots coming up all over the place <eou> my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that <eou> gee <eou> i have to hang these things high <eou> they ca n't get to them <eou> especially the catnip <eou> how many cats do you have <eou> three <eou> okay <eou> i just put a little fence around my yard which is i suppose technically illegal <eou> i had so many groundhogs last year that i think they 'll let me get by with it <eou> it 's got this one inch mesh <eou> what i 've noticed it 's kept the cats out <eou> i love it <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> because they like to get in and fertilize things too <eou> why would it be illegal <eou> because we have these tow- <eou> i live in a townhouse <eou> all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> they want privacy fences <eou> if nobody complains you 're all right <eou> right <eou> right <eou> they do walking tours too <eou> at least because i back up to a hillside where the wild animals are i think i can probably justify it <eou> yeah <eou> an <eou> if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway <eou> right <eou> right <eou> i me- <eou> you do n't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property <eou> right <eou> the first year the deer ate my garden <eou> i was just astounded <eou> i 'm going deer right here in the city <eou> yeah <eou> right here bambi <eou> exactly <eou> gosh <eou> let 's see <eou> other than gardening which i fiddle at <eou> i 'm not very good at <eou> what else do i mostly just computer stuff <eou> oh <eou> i just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that <eou> cooking that 's not really a hobby <eou> it 's a necessity <eou> i enjoy it <eou> i like to think that i 'm a very good cook <eou> great <eou> hobbies <eou> that 's about it <eou> i do n't have much time for hobbies between being a student and trying to run a business on the side <eou> you do n't have a lot of time <eou> right <eou> that keeps you busy <eou> yeah <eou> raising cats <eou> that could become a hobby <eou> it started out as a hobby <eou> uh-huh <eou> it developed into sort of a business <eou> we breed them and all that <eou> we did n't really start it for the money <eou> it was just <eou> they were fun to have around <eou> we figured if we 're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds <eou> now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them and all this kind of stuff <eou> uh-huh <eou> what kind of cats are they <eou> i 've got a bombay a turkish van and a himalayan persian <eou> wow <eou> yeah <eou> the is probably the sweetest one <eou> she 's just a little sweetheart <eou> we <eou> the bombay had a litter last october <eou> w- <eou> i just got her back from the vet this morning getting her spayed <eou> only going to breed them once <eou> okay <eou> she 's not feeling too great today <eou> is that typical to only breed them once <eou> no <eou> most breeders are in it for the money <eou> they 'll breed them twice a year i just think that i do n't know it 's kind of cruel <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> they just breed these they breed them before they 're ready you 're never rea- <eou> right <eou> they do a lot of inbreeding too <eou> you end up with kind of strange kittens <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i just do n't like that <eou> will you breed one of the litter then next year <eou> we sold all that litter <eou> oh <eou> we <eou> there 's not that much call for bombays <eou> uh-huh <eou> they 're registered <eou> they 're not they 're not show cats <eou> i see <eou> all you can do is sell them as pet quality <eou> uh-huh <eou> what you 've got is a registered pet <eou> not too many people want bombays <eou> they want things like himie persians and turkish vans <eou> uh-huh <eou> turkish vans if you 've never seen one you would n't know that it was a pure bred <eou> it 's just medium size short hair cat <eou> it 's got <eou> he 's mostly white with brown and black patches <eou> oh <eou> they have nice personalities <eou> they 're very inquisitive <eou> the himie we 'll probably breed her a couple of times <eou> we 'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those <eou> right <eou> it 's just the stud fees are so much though <eou> it 'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her <eou> we want to breed her with a champion <eou> right <eou> now these are long haired <eou> yeah <eou> the persian is <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> the other two are short hairs <eou> right <eou> that 's nice <eou> yeah <eou> she 's sweet <eou> going to have some nice kittens i hope <eou> uh-huh <eou> she 's <eou> if you know what a himalayan is generally they look something like <eou> they come in a lot of different colors <eou> people do n't realize it <eou> they 're sort of siamese in a way <eou> they have the gloves on the paws <eou> they 're usually two colored <eou> this one is <eou> she 's predominantly black <eou> she has chocolate paws chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters <eou> gee <eou> yeah <eou> she 's quite attractive looking <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> hope the stud will find her attractive <eou> that she has kittens that look like her <eou> that she has a whole bunch of kittens <eou> we have to be careful <eou> we have to get a particular color point stud <eou> you ca n't just breed them with anything <eou> we have to get a silver point himie <eou> that the silver will be predominate in the kittens <eou> i see <eou> that 's the fun part trying to figure out what you 've got to breed them with <eou> ca n't just go out there and say you guys breed <eou> you ca n't just tell them that anyway <eou> that 's right <eou> it really sounds like a business more than a hobby <eou> it is a business in a way <eou> it 's a lot of fun as a hobby especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats <eou> we 're about to get another breed <eou> we 're going to buy a <eou> i do n't like at first <eou> what is it <eou> it 's a mutant <eou> it comes from england and in the county of devon <eou> oh <eou> it 's a mutant cat <eou> they 're pretty expensive <eou> we 're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one <eou> they 're very thin <eou> they 're they 're long and lanky and skinny <eou> they have real short hair <eou> it 's curly as a matter of fact <eou> interesting <eou> yeah <eou> it it 's a strange looking cat <eou> i did n't like them at first <eou> they 've got great big ears <eou>
are you in the market for a new car <eou> yeah <eou> i am as a matter of fact <eou> i 'm looking for another car <eou> new <eou> probably not <eou> oh <eou> what sort of requirements to you have for your car <eou> sports car <eou> uh-huh <eou> usually black red <eou> uh-huh <eou> and electric windows and power locks <eou> i see <eou> top of the line <eou> not so much that as it is <eou> i 've had so many times when i 'll have a friend next to me or i see guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window <eou> oh <eou> it is just a real pain <eou> if i 'm driving along and there 's somebody next to me and somebody that i know and you try to talk to them it 's real difficult to drive reach over and try to roll down the window <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> right <eou> power locks power windows are just things that just really help a lot <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> what about you <eou> i guess i 'm more traditional in that i do n't like power windows or power locks because the people that i know who have them always seem to have trouble with them <eou> oh <eou> i just do n't like anything that i ca n't figure out why it does n't work <eou> sure <eou> i want good gas mileage <eou> i want an air bag <eou> i guess <eou> have you ever had a car with an air bag <eou> no <eou> i have n't <eou> have you <eou> no <eou> somehow i just think i like the idea <eou> it sure seems to save lives <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> i like the anti-lock brakes <eou> right <eou> that 's a good idea <eou> i have never had a chance to <eou> i have been in cars that have had them <eou> i 've never tromped on the brakes on ice or water just to see if they did n't lock up <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> you think you 'd buy an american car or a european or japanese <eou> i do n't know a lot about different brands <eou> i tend to have my requirements like the last time i bought a car i guess i did sort of prefer american <eou> my requirements were basically good repair record good mileage <eou> i needed air-conditioning <eou> ca n't remember what my <eou> i wanted stick shift i did n't have a whole lot of choice <eou> there was one car in all of the metropolitan area that i could find that was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it <eou> what was that <eou> it turned out to be a chrysler lancer <eou> huh <eou> stick shift <eou> huh <eou> yeah <eou> did it have what a three speed or a four speed <eou> no <eou> a five speed <eou> basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and had n't picked up <eou> it had been on the lot three months <eou> they were really eager to sell it <eou> wow <eou> i guess in this area at least if it 's not automatic it does n't move <eou> i much prefer a stick shift <eou> what i 'm curious <eou> i know why i love a stick shift <eou> why did you want one <eou> i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one <eou> i thought it would be more reliable <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's hard to find stick shift cars anymore <eou> i found that out <eou> the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when i went in to and asked and that was a requirement <eou> huh <eou> yeah <eou> no <eou> most of the sports cars are stick shift <eou> i 'm not even sure all of them are anymore at least in this area <eou> huh <eou> not that i was looking for sports cars <eou> the people i 've talked to do n't seem to have stick shift <eou> huh <eou> why do you like stick shift <eou> i guess i grew up on it it 's fun <eou> it 's an enjoyable part of driving <eou> i do feel like i have more control over the car <eou> uh-huh <eou> it to me it gives me more a lot more control in snow and ice and slick conditions <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> it does <eou> i do n't know <eou> it 's really more fun than anything <eou> as long as you 're not stuck in heavy traffic it 's fun <eou> right <eou> it 's probably safer on long trips because it keeps you more active <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> of course i like gadgets and fun things on the cars which are all the things course the c- <eou>
all right ( ( carolyn <eou> when do ) ) you <eou> are you reading the papers about the middle east summit <eou> some <eou> yes <eou> i 'm just a little bit too <eou> i think i was worn out from middle east after the war <eou> yeah <eou> i think it did n't really take over the first page quite as much as it did i think during the war <eou> uh-huh <eou> we definitely need something there with all the hostages and what all <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> wha- <eou> that 's i think <eou> i do n't know in the short run it would be really nice to get the hostages all back <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think that 's really really important <eou> yeah <eou> i think they just have a whole different world than we do <eou> i do n't know <eou> i do n't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be <eou> i just see this middle east situation with russia and everything there that 's happened i think that that crisis has kind of slowed down <eou> i see the middle east as being the real hot spot of the future so to speak <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> i guess i view it as being the prime importance as far as trying to wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> i think <eou> i do n't know i just have this civil rights mentality i guess <eou> you know should we <eou> should we <eou> i wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do <eou> uh-huh <eou> i guess that 's what i hope for them <eou> some of them do n't want those freedoms i think <eou> their religious beliefs may not <eou> they may not want it as a whole <eou> i think that 's something that has to be considered too <eou> yeah <eou> i think that 's really a long term type thing <eou> i know that the <eou> it said think about long term repercussions <eou> i was just thinking peace is peace <eou> uh-huh <eou> that really is the nicest thing <eou> i guess the question in my mind somewhat <eou> it depends on the country <eou> i think some are more peaceful than others <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> if you look at iraq for example and the recent thing with the u n going in there and the bomb development and all this kind of stuff <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> gosh <eou> i think we should have got him while we could or whatever <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i think so <eou> i think <eou> i think there 's a certain mentality to that 's in the middle east the constant fighting <eou> right <eou> i think they realized we would probably never push him out <eou> i think the other <eou> probably all of the other arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out <eou> yeah <eou> i think they look at force as a way of their means to their ends <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> yep <eou> i do n't know so much if these peace talks are going to <eou> i do n't know how much they 'll stay to them <eou> uh-huh <eou> if we even if we say that we 're going to do stuff i do n't know how they 'll stick to that <eou> yeah <eou> i think the thing is though i guess the arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any ideas that coincide with the u s ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the soviet union <eou> uh-huh <eou> i guess that 's all gone <eou> i think that 's really probably what started the whole process <eou> uh-huh <eou> i <eou> that 's probably a bonus on our part <eou> yeah <eou> yes <eou> it is <eou> i think that they 're so much more vulnerable now because they do n't receive support from the soviet union <eou> uh-huh <eou> i guess they 're saying we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries two ways <eou> we can act like we 're going to be pro-communist act like we 're going to be pro-democracy <eou> whatever gets us the most that 's what we 'll act like we 're going to do <eou> we really wo n't change in the long run <eou> yeah <eou> i think that 's the way i sort of see them all working <eou> i tend to agree with you <eou> yeah <eou> i think they have in mind what they want to do <eou> i think a lot of times their <eou> uh-huh <eou> it <eou> kind of the forceful <eou> i do n't know <eou> i just do n't think peace is uppermost in their minds <eou> yeah <eou> it 's really funny as an american and always being an ally with the israelis <eou> i always find it very hard in my heart to align with the israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the arabs <eou> uh-huh <eou> then again they have to live in that environment <eou> they have to be subjected to all of the arab bombings and terrorist attacks and whatever <eou> yeah <eou> then they have to negotiate almost everything <eou> then you think to yourself in your heart you do n't want to be aligned with somebody that 's mean and cruel to someone else <eou> if that 's the environment that they have to live in and survive in then you have to sort of <eou> i do n't know <eou> logically <eou>

them live in that area <eou> it was n't too hard for them to come in the day and leave <eou> uh-huh <eou> that was a great big thing <eou> we do that with his family about every five years a great big one <eou> immediate family we try to do one thing once a year <eou> how many people are in his immediate family <eou> he has eight brothers and sisters <eou> wow <eou> that 's big by itself <eou> wow

scattered <eou> let 's see <eou> there are four of them who live here in texas and his mom and dad <eou> uh-huh <eou> the others live in close neighboring states like nevada arizona i think like that <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> wow <eou> that 's wonderful <eou> it 's been fun <eou> how about you <eou> we do n't really get together <eou> i would love to <eou> that 's why i checked that i wanted to do that because i would love to plan a family reunion sometime <eou> i have a sister in colorado and a sister in upstate new york and a sister in connecticut and here i am in texas <eou> we 're kind of scattered right now <eou> uh-huh <eou> my cousins they put on a family reunion once a year <eou> it 's always like the second week in september <eou> it 's <eou> the kids are already back in school <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's back in the <eou> that 's hard <eou> that 's in new york <eou> there 's just no possible way <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it 's not really a weekend <eou> it 's just like a day kind of thing because most of them are <eou> my family moved to connecticut <eou> the rest of the family stayed in new york and on long island <eou> uh-huh <eou> they 're all kind of local and close <eou> they just have a day picnic <eou> i 've always thought it would be so neat even if it were just my immediate family to have like a weekend type thing <eou> yeah <eou> that would be so wonderful <eou> it really is fun <eou> my mom 's family does it once a year just like you said <eou> uh-huh <eou> once a year they have a a wednesday through a saturday type thing <eou> you can come and go as you please type thing <eou> wow <eou> they do that once a year <eou> i kind of missed it this year and felt bad <eou> you ca n't go every year <eou> you just can not do that <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> do they have a hotel <eou> where do you stay <eou> basically they just stay with each other brothers or sisters <eou> there are enough in the area to just kind of span yourself out <eou> take everybody <eou> yeah <eou> whoever 's mom and dad it is you usually go and stay with them <eou> i go stay with my mother <eou> my cousins they just go stay with their mom and dad kind of thing <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's not hard in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one utah area <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> that 's not hard the real planning that 's the real key <eou> that sounds so wonderful <eou> is n't that nice <eou> yeah <eou> they send out <eou> my mom 's family now <eou> this is the first reunion with my husband 's family i 've really been involved with <eou> my mom 's family each brother and sister takes a turn one year <eou> that 's how they divide it up <eou> uh-huh <eou> then one brother and sister from each family <eou> uh-huh <eou> each one of them take their turn <eou> wow <eou> uh-huh <eou> the parent who 's turn it is her children help her <eou> uh-huh <eou> if it was my mother 's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing <eou> i see uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> wow <eou> yeah <eou> the thing is that the real part is there are two mailings that go out <eou> the first one is to just kind of give an approximate date and time so you can start making <eou>
have you got a pet <eou> y- <eou> no <eou> i do n't <eou> an <eou> my kids would love a pet <eou> i had a pet when i was a girl <eou> i had a cocker spaniel <eou> i think one thing about pets is they 're a lot of company <eou> yeah <eou> you can tell them anything <eou> they wo n't tell anybody <eou> that 's right <eou> that 's unconditional affection <eou> right <eou> as a matter of fact i was thinking that same thing unconditional love <eou> they just give it and do n't expect too much <eou> yeah <eou> do you have a pet <eou> i had a cat <eou> i 've had several cats <eou> my pet was hit by a car new year 's eve <eou> oh <eou> i 'm going to get another one as soon as i get back in town <eou> i 'm going out of town this weekend <eou> when i get back i 'm going to find a cat <eou> i 'm so sorry <eou> that 's good that you 're going to get another one <eou> yeah <eou> i know some of my friends who have pets <eou> they just are really <eou> the ones that have dogs are very protective of them <eou> i think that 's one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets <eou> they just really take care of them or are protective of them <eou> ye- <eou> i work and go to school <eou> it 's kind of nice <eou> tha- <eou> you come home your pet 's there for you and wants a little food a little attention <eou> yeah <eou> an <eou> my kids <eou> that 's <eou> it 's kind of fun <eou> they really want a dog badly <eou> they 've been looking and looking <eou> want <eou> they 'd take anything i think <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know do you like <eou> i guess your cat was an indoor cat <eou> no <eou> it was kind of indoor outdoor it was <eou> it kind of traveled around <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't care for the smell of the litter box <eou> my cat was trained to go outside <eou> other than that it was inside when it wanted to be it was outside when <eou> yeah <eou> when i had a cocker spaniel it was an outdoor dog <eou> i think i liked that better <eou> yeah <eou> i think <eou> i like dogs <eou> i think that <eou> i 'm <eou> kind of like big dogs <eou> you have to have room for them <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true <eou> dogs take a lot more care than cats do <eou> cats are pretty independent <eou> you feed them <eou> they keep themselves clean if you raise them right you do n't have to worry about the litter box thing where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and things like that <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true <eou> take them for walks <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> i see all the people on sunday going for a walk with their dogs <eou> i 'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog <eou> i 'm like i know it will be fun the first week maybe <eou> yeah <eou> mom gets to take care of it or something <eou> i gue- <eou> yeah <eou> i got to take care of a friend of mine 's dog <eou> he 's just got a puppy <eou> he was out of town last weekend <eou> of course the dog is not trained for anything yet <eou> it was go over there and clean up after the dog <eou> that 's exciting <eou> yeah <eou> kids kind of <eou> they want the fun part and not the work <eou> yeah <eou> i think it 's really important to that if you get a pet that they 're spayed neutered so that we 're not just going on with this pet population and having to just get rid of them <eou> yeah <eou> that kind of gripes on me some <eou> i do n't know <eou> if you 're going to have a pet and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to deal with the consequences take care of the offspring <eou> more and more people are <eou> right <eou> right <eou> i think <eou> when i was growing up we had cats <eou> just seeing the miracle of birth that 's a neat thing to experience as a kid and understand <eou> i think that 's really true <eou> it was a real positive thing <eou> on the other hand you do n't want to be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road <eou> yeah <eou> they 're they 're getting old now <eou> it 's time to get rid of them <eou> yeah <eou> exactly <eou> exactly <eou> i think our community is a lot more conscious now though too <eou> that 's good too <eou> yeah <eou> i think that 's all i have to say <eou> okay <eou> okay <eou> have a good night <eou> all right <eou> bye-bye <eou> bye <eou>
i basically listen to the news from the t v <eou> that 's probably the only time i get a chance to take a look at it is the evening news <eou> if i 'm lucky i might be able to hear something through news wise <eou> other than that that 's probably how i get my source unless something really tragic happens and somebody tells me it about through conversation or whatever <eou> most of the time it is through the news in the evening <eou> that 's about the <eou> you do n't get any newspapers <eou> newspapers <eou> no <eou> i 'm not too much in reading newspapers <eou> not that i do n't enjoy newspapers or anything like that <eou> part of it is because i just do n't feel like i need to have them with watching the t v or whatever <eou> we get our weekly news around the area <eou> i might look through it real quick if there 's something that catches my interest in regards to what 's going on around the county or little bit of the state <eou> the majority of the time now i do n't get a daily newspaper where i get tons of news coming in that kind of stuff <eou> i 'm kind of the opposite of you <eou> i get all my news from newspapers <eou> you do <eou> we have two newspapers <eou> you read it in the morning then <eou> yeah <eou> two newspapers in the morning i 'm in a government position that i 'm in the news a lot <eou> uh-huh <eou> sure <eou> i kind of look through to see what i 'm quoted in <eou> sure <eou> how bad the quotes are every day <eou> to see if they did it or if they criticize you or put something in there wrong <eou> yeah <eou> sure <eou> sure <eou> sometimes there 's letter to the editor about me <eou> there 's a even editorials for against what i 'm doing <eou> uh-huh <eou> sure <eou> sure <eou> exactly <eou> the t v i do n't really watch even if i 'm on it <eou> uh-huh <eou> sure <eou> just <eou> that 's kind of like you said then <eou> we are kind of on the opposite where i get home and while i 'm cooking supper the t v is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on <eou> very seldom do i catch the ten o'clock <eou> by that time old news is probably what i hear through the grapevine or whatever <eou> unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then i think everybody was glued to the t v to find out what was going on <eou> right <eou> other than that no <eou> it 's <eou> that 's <eou> c n n had the { f uh <eou> } everybody was watching c n n <eou> that seemed to be the place to be to find out what was going on on that <eou> exactly <eou> exactly <eou> exactly <eou> sure <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it brought kind of more of a vivid look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true <eou> a lot of people that read the newspapers to get the news of what 's going on <eou> other people that do it differently or do n't even watch any news at all <eou> the thing is with t v i <eou> a lot of times the news on the local t v is so brief you really do n't get the full picture of what 's going on <eou> exactly happens <eou> sure <eou> sure <eou> that 's <eou> that 's a problem that i have is not getting just a little brief idea of what 's happening <eou> sure <eou> a clip a sentence or two <eou> that 's about it of what went on <eou> they have so much other information to cover in such a short period of time <eou> sure <eou> right i like the weather report <eou> makes sense <eou> yeah <eou> i wa- <eou> always i always turn that on <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> that 's one part i watch because i go surfing down here <eou> i always want to watch the weather for when the waves are going to be good <eou> uh-huh <eou> you 're right on the coast line <eou> you 're not further up <eou> you 're <eou> yeah <eou> no <eou> uh-huh <eou> sure <eou> sure <eou> i suppose you watch for hurricanes coming in and things like that <eou> yeah <eou> sure <eou> yeah <eou> weather channel 's good <eou> yeah <eou> that 's about the only time in the summer if you 're watching t v for the weather even though it 's very hard to predict what 's going on <eou> they 'll kind of say there 's a thunderstorm warning or whatever <eou> this is what is expected <eou> a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically so fast where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> i can predict my week and where i 'm going to be <eou> uh-huh <eou> sure <eou> i can be at the beach when the waves start coming in <eou> to take off <eou> sure <eou> yeah <eou> that 's <eou> sounds pretty good <eou> anyway i do n't know if our time is getting up here <eou> it 's got to be fairly close to that <eou>
alright allen <eou> the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of american women in the past several generations in the society we live in <eou> what do you think has occurred there <eou> i think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home <eou> that 's probably one of the major changes i see over the last period of time <eou> uh-huh <eou> are they being given the full honor for the work they are doing what they have to accept that 's they are responsible for <eou> responsibilities is what i am trying to say <eou> i do n't think so <eou> i think it has come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities <eou> uh-huh <eou> i still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals <eou> in other words in some respects the other direction in some job markets they do n't really want to be treated as equals <eou> by the same token in most cases women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who have been there before but at lower salaries <eou> yes <eou> i think that 's generally speaking pretty true <eou> is that right and wrong <eou> i think that 's what we really ought to look at that if they are going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay <eou> yes <eou> they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do n't think that we have gotten there yet <eou> yeah <eou> what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years <eou> any individual thing <eou> is it just a general switch over <eou> i think it 's generally that switch over <eou> i think that switch over has been more in the work force <eou> i do n't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force <eou> i think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home that the husband is having them on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home <eou> uh-huh <eou> they have one and three quarters jobs now whereas the husbands have one and a quarter <eou> yeah <eou> this upsets the man because we have always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household <eou> do you think that is going to be difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years <eou> yes <eou> yeah <eou> i think also in terms of parenting <eou> i think there is going to be some increasing problem because i think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting <eou> i am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units <eou> do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation specifically <eou> i think one of the things that always happens is i think is when the one end were moving out to the end where a lot of women will be at work <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties <eou> the opinion of this career thing is n't all that it is cracked up to be <eou> i want to go back and do something else <eou> i think we will probably see the pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit <eou> uh-huh <eou> also much of it is driven by economics right now <eou> yes <eou> people have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in <eou> i mo- <eou> a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that 's what everybody else assumes they are going to get <eou> yeah <eou> the people <eou> how do you feel about women in armed services <eou> i think they ought to have the right <eou> i have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife and my daughter going into combat <eou> yeah <eou> i have problems with men doing that <eou> i guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it <eou> it 's nothing i would be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for it <eou> yeah <eou> i somehow ca n't do that <eou> i was brought up in the ages where the ladies were kept home safe secure and made happy <eou> the men went out and took responsibility of earning the money bringing in whatever they needed and protected the household <eou> it really still bothers me <eou> i spent plenty of years in the service <eou> it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or out in places where there is two or three of them there and five hundred men around <eou> how are they going to protect themselves so to speak <eou> i agree <eou> it puts them in a very bad situation <eou> i really do n't go for that <eou> i think one of the other things that has concerned me a little bit <eou> i think i see some change in attitudes there <eou> my wife happens to be a wife who has chosen to stay at home <eou> uh-huh <eou> there 's has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who did n't have much intelligence because if she did she would be out in the work force fulfilling herself <eou> yep <eou> you 're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home going <eou> i hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do that 's acceptable <eou> yeah <eou> if they chose to go into the work force that 's okay <eou> yeah <eou> if they chose not to that 's acceptable <eou> if they go into the work force they should be treated as nicely as well as a man or any other person <eou> as equals <eou> not <eou>
