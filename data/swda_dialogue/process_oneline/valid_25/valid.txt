okay bill <eou> as you think over the plans and so forth that the company you 're working with now <eou> who do you work with at this time <eou> i own the company <eou> you own the company <eou> all right <eou> i 'm the president and c e o of the company <eou> my goodness <eou> i guess i determine what the benefits are <eou> yeah <eou> i guess you do <eou> what are you asking me <eou> what benefits i think are most important <eou> what do you think of the <eou> let 's put it this way <eou> what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you other than their present salary <eou> i 'd say in today 's economy besides basic benefits such as health insurance and life insurance and some type of retirement plan i 'd say that most of the employees that we have really like a profit sharing plan <eou> uh-huh <eou> a profit sharing plan <eou> that 's interesting <eou> uh-huh <eou> they like to participate in the profits of the company like they 're <eou> because they feel like we 're contributing to it <eou> we 'd like to participate in it <eou> that means i make a little bit less <eou> the thing is that really you make a little more because everybody has a interest in it working <eou> yes <eou> they have a specific reason to do so because they themselves benefit from doing a better job <eou> right <eou> i think most people do n't want money <eou> it 's been my experience most people want to feel like they 're participating in something that is not a drudgery that they enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's a contribution <eou> right <eou> bill that idea fits me exactly <eou> i just retired from the university here <eou> that 's been the goal in my life was to contribute to the work that i was doing in my research <eou> that 's what made me happy <eou> that 's the type of goal i think most people ought to look for <eou> i 'm sure a lot of them do n't <eou> you ca n't stand in front of a counter and do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that you 're contributing something to a scientific level of knowledge or so forth <eou> yeah <eou> our people get a lot of satisfaction <eou> we 're a financial planning firm <eou> you 're a financial planning firm <eou> yes <eou> how many <eou> you said you retired <eou> i just happen to have a person that i happened to do some planning for this morning we deal with a lot of people that are retired or trying to retire <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's real important that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work where they were that that it take care of them <eou> they do n't <eou> none of them really want to be rich <eou> they like to have enough to be comfortable <eou> what changes have you considered in doing it to your company that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better <eou> we considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a salary is tie a percentage of business that a person would participate and bring into the company <eou> pay them based on the percentage of business they bring instead of based on their salary <eou> the re- <eou> when you say bring in do you mean that they negotiated with people to come in and ask for your support <eou> no <eou> not necessarily <eou> it can be in-house people who help you handle x amount of dollars <eou> okay <eou> uh-huh <eou> even though they did n't bring it in they help it once it 's there <eou> right we have marketing people <eou> yeah <eou> we have financial planners <eou> we have staff secretaries and administrative assistants <eou> these secretaries and administrative assistants if we do n't have their cooperation and they 're not participating in the profit of the company they can get very dissatisfied very quickly <eou> uh-huh <eou> we 're thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle <eou> administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business <eou> yes <eou> it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job <eou> it might be whether the locality there those people want that kind of support <eou> to <eou> the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they 're the assistant to or that they usually have several people they report to that they work together with it encourages them not to complain when they realize that they get a part of the action based on their efforts and not based on being sitting back saying make me do it <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> we do n't want anybody around here that says make me do it <eou> i do n't think any <eou> yeah <eou> i think most people want to be lack of better terminology they want to be self-employed <eou> they do n't want to take the risk <eou> in other words they like to control their own future <eou> they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please without some real strict adherence <eou> that 's true <eou> which <eou> that 's what we have <eou> uh-huh <eou>
okay do you like to cook <eou> i love to cook as a matter of fact i 'm making dinner right now <eou> really <eou> what are you making <eou> i 'm making some <eou> i have a little turkey left from a passover whi- which was in april <eou> uh-huh <eou> i had frozen it <eou> i 'm defrosting that and making some dressing and gravy and making corn and wheat stuff that you can buy at a store which is like rice pilaf <eou> uh-huh <eou> we <eou> with with wheat kernel that <eou> do you cook <eou> are you single do you cook every night for yourself <eou> no <eou> i 'm married <eou> the <eou> my wife is a vegetarian <eou> uh-huh <eou> this is n't for her <eou> this is for our friends that came over and helped me do some stuff <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> stuff <eou> uh-huh <eou> he and i <eou> she 's having <eou> i do cook virtually <eou> i cook most of the time because i <eou> uh-huh <eou> if you were having a dinner party what would you cook a variety of things vegetarian and nonvegetarian <eou> yeah <eou> we consistently <eou> if we cook <eou> if we have a dinner party we usually make it vegetarian just to make life easier <eou> uh-huh <eou> we 'll make some sort of pasta or something homemade pasta or lasagna or something <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> that 's something that 's really easy <eou> in fact i 'm having a dinner party next saturday <eou> that is what i 'm having is pasta for christmas i got a pasta machine <eou> good idea <eou> what <eou> all my friends are really anxious to have the homemade noodles <eou> electric or <eou> no <eou> it 's the hand kind old fashion kind <eou> best kind <eou> that that that 's <eou> we bought one in italy <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's the best kind to have <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's real good <eou> yeah <eou> that 's what i 'm going to be cooking <eou> i thought i would <eou> pasta salad first <eou> then } just something for desert bread and wine and cheese stuff like that <eou> that would be great <eou> have you made pasta before <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> that it 's a lot of fun <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i <eou> a lot of people think though that i 've talked to about it think that it 's a lot of hard work <eou> i said it 's kind of easy <eou> it actually is if if you have a food processor <eou> i do n't know if you have a food processor or not it turns out that i- if if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply <eou> yeah <eou> i do <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> right <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's also <eou> people think it 's real hard <eou> it just time consuming to get all of the little things right <eou> uh-huh <eou> otherwise it 's real <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's good stuff <eou> what other kinds of dinner parties do you serve <eou> i do n't entertain that often <eou> when i do though i have some friends that i always like to experiment on <eou> i see a recipe and think i 'd really like to try this cause i 'm single <eou> i live by myself <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's not necessarily something that i would cook just for myself <eou> right <eou> you did n't want to cook <eou> here we go <eou> usually i 'm pretty good about it <eou> that 's great <eou> i have this really good recipe for this pork chop and apple casserole kind of thing <eou> you put stuffing and put poached apples and everything <eou> my girlfriend and her husband loved it in fact she passed it on to her parent <eou> i was quite impressed with myself if i should say so <eou> yeah <eou> that 's of make it for one person as an experiment little bit and little here and there <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'm the kind of cook that i do n't normally measure things <eou> i just kind of throw them in <eou> i do n't to the point of measuring down to the exact amount that they say <eou> that means you 're a real cook <eou> is that what it means <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's real good <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> we do middle eastern dinner quite a bit <eou> uh-huh <eou> no <eou> i have n't <eou> we make cause we 're my wife is syrian <eou> uh-huh <eou> her families always have this food she grew up in <eou> i 've made some of it before as well <eou> uh-huh <eou> we make four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple <eou> uh-huh <eou> we put them out for people <eou> that 's always a real big kick for people who 've never tried it before <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's that 's that 's a fun idea if you ever want something different to try <eou> uh-huh <eou> i would try that <eou> yeah <eou> i 've been wanting to take an oriental cooking class <eou> i just have n't gotten around to it yet <eou> do you have a wok though <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i stir fry things on occasion <eou> i 'd like to know more about more elaborate things like guess <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's easy <eou> the food just comes out <eou> if you do it right i think the food comes out very tasty not very mushy <eou> uh-huh <eou> it does n't taste like a million calories of oil <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> really <eou> yeah <eou> we we like to eat even when we eat out stuff we eat a lot of chinese food or japanese food or korean <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> that seems to <eou> wok food seems to be our thing <eou> uh-huh <eou> anything else you cook <eou> i just kind of cook here cook there <eou> i do n't have any one specialty <eou> i 'm always willing to try anything usually <eou> that 's good <eou> that 's always the way to do it <eou> i think <eou> i especially like baking and making deserts <eou> i 've taken a cake decorating class <eou> the wilson course <eou> no <eou> no <eou> it was a private course through a com- <eou> that 's great <eou> i have n't the wilson class <eou> it 's it 's neat it takes a long time <eou> it 's like you bake the cakes <eou> i guess just because i do n't have the expertise to just hurry up and do it like a professional would i go real slow <eou> right <eou> it 's a little time consuming <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's really worth your effort once you see how you do <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> we have <eou> my brother can do it <eou> uh-huh <eou> he 's got a degree in business management <eou> he learned how to do this <eou> uh-huh <eou> can you hold on one second <eou> sure <eou> thank you <eou> sorry about that <eou> that 's okay <eou> some one kept beeping in our calling waiting <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> he does that a lot <eou> he cooks a lot he bakes a lot whenever he <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> he made a real big cake himself <eou> uh-huh <eou> it was amazing <eou> i never could do anything with cakes it 's just horrible <eou> uh-huh <eou> you learn helpful hints in the classes at least <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm <eou> the instructor told us certain things about do n't follow what 's really necessarily on the box if you 're making just a cake from a box do this cause make it a variety yeah <eou> that you mean about the mix itself <eou> that helps <eou> some different hints the different kinds of frostings you can make <eou> i have a book an it <eou> all of the different decorating tips an things like that <eou> yeah <eou> most frostings are sort of butter cream to are n't they * [ [ to = too <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> those kill me <eou> it 's like i 'm eating sugar <eou> they 're good sugar <eou> yeah <eou> i think part of the problem <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> that 's about it <eou> yeah <eou> i guess so <eou> okay <eou> it was a pleasure chatting with you <eou> it was nice talking to you <eou> yes <eou> have a good time cooking for your dinner party next week <eou> thank you <eou> bye-bye <eou> bye-bye <eou>
i 'll tell you why i feel so <eou> i feel strongly about this topic <eou> i do n't know a whole lot about the immigration laws <eou> i do know that in the where i live and i teach school there are so many orientals that have come here <eou> there 's a lot of mexican people too which is not neither here nor there <eou> the fact is that all the orientals that are here are very affluent very wise in money matters and have taken over a lot of businesses <eou> have <eou> ki- <eou> it 's kind of scary because they 're so bright <eou> all the kids that i have that are oriental are really far above the american kids <eou> they <eou> the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up <eou> money is their main goal <eou> it really is kind of scary because there 's just oodles of them <eou> you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by orientals <eou> it 's kind of scares me not that i do n't want them here and not that i do n't appreciate the fact that they have rights too <eou> on the other hand you feel like almost they 're invading us to the point where they 're going to take over <eou> right <eou> my son once said that perhaps what we should do is buy a little square of land some place in the midwest <eou> that might be the solution <eou> i think probably that 's <eou> uh-huh <eou> i was born in ohio <eou> uh-huh <eou> it really <eou> there are a lot of mexican people here because we 're so close to the border <eou> uh-huh <eou> they are wonderful people <eou> i do n't want to deny them their rights <eou> just that you you feel like when you were born and raised here and you worked very hard to make this country what it is it scares you when you feel like somebody 's taking over <eou> a lot of these people plan one day to go back to vietnam or to taiwan or wherever they 're from and take with them a lot of american dollars plus a lot of power in american com- companies <eou> it 's kind of scary <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do n't know <eou> i do n't know the immigration laws that <eou> i do not <eou> in fact i do n't know them at all <eou> i do n't know how many people they allow in the united states per year or if there 's even a <eou> i do n't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore <eou> do you know anything about that <eou> no <eou> i do n't <eou> i do n't know <eou> i lived in the middle east for sometime <eou> i do believe there must have been some sort of quota system because i know a lot of people that in a sense certainly were deserving to come <eou> oh <eou> uh-huh <eou> it seemed to take them a long time <eou> there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come <eou> yeah <eou> i would guess that there are quotas for different places <eou> i would think so too <eou> it <eou> i i think there 's something about being able to claim imminent danger <eou> i 'm not sure what the terminology is <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> maybe political a- <eou> asylum of some sort <eou> yeah <eou> there you go <eou> you got the term <eou> uh-huh <eou> maybe that 's an issue with a lot of people <eou> i do n't know <eou> i guess i have n't been in a situation where it 's been threatening to me <eou> my kids go to school in another suburb of dallas with very very good school systems <eou> they 're considered one of the top three in the state both of them <eou> uh-huh <eou> it seems like a lot of the orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools <eou> uh-huh <eou> they 're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here <eou> the kids in this area are very bright and come from parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and very interested in their education <eou> i think in the last year if i 'm not mistaken in four of the six high schools the graduating class valedictorian and salutatorian were half or more oriental <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> they 're just extremely bright kids <eou> also they value learning <eou> i was going to say i would guess that it 's not that they are any brighter <eou> they just maybe work harder <eou> i think things come easy for them too <eou> i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the united states <eou> they do n't want to work for anything <eou> they want it to come to them and be there <eou> they do n't want to work hard <eou> these kids work really hard <eou> right <eou> right <eou> may- <eou> they have <eou> maybe part of that 's the problem that here we 've let this value slip <eou> yeah <eou> i know <eou> i agree with that <eou> they need to have some competition <eou> what i see is y- <eou> the competition is there <eou> instead of meeting the challenge they 're starting to resent them <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's causing i think some problems <eou> that 's too bad <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's mainly black and and hispanic <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> there has been some resentment with orientals in the black community because they 've started businesses there <eou> the blacks resent them coming in and taking their money <eou> there 's been some violence because of it <eou> that 's really sad <eou> it is <eou> it is very sad <eou> uh-huh <eou> i really <eou> i 've i 've always prided myself on not being prejudiced and welcoming everyone that wants to come here <eou> uh-huh <eou> even when i was younger when i was in college i was a member of the n a a c p because i lived up north <eou> i was very into the human rights part of everything <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 've i 've become very cynical in the last three four years living in texas <eou> uh-huh <eou> it sounds like you feel that there is need for change <eou> maybe the e- <eou> there is too big of a concentration coming all at once to allow for adequate melting into the society <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> exactly <eou> that 's exactly true <eou> plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time two two three four maybe five years and then go back and pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them <eou> plus a lot of american dollars <eou> in the long run maybe that 's going to make a better world too <eou> right <eou> you just do n't know <eou> exactly <eou> an- <eou> yet with <eou> there 's somebody on my other line <eou> i 'm going to ignore that <eou> oh <eou> i just <eou> you kind of you don- you really do n't know what to do <eou> i do n't <eou> i want my kids to have values where they 're accepting and so forth <eou> uh-huh <eou> both of my children are really more tolerant of blacks and hispanics than they are of the orientals for some reason <eou> they feel like they 've taken over <eou> they feel like they 're taking some of the rewards that they should have <eou> right <eou> i really do n't want that to happen it 's happening <eou> right <eou> right <eou> right <eou> i think a lot of their friends feel the same way too <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i really do wish i knew about quotas and really wish i <eou> right <eou> i would suspect that they have <eou> i guess i do n't have much much more to contribute to the topic <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't really either <eou> i wish i knew more <eou> yeah <eou> probably if i did i might be a little bit more tolerant perhaps <eou> uh-huh <eou> i <eou> even if i really wish i knew the situations they were going back to or coming from <eou> uh-huh <eou> you do n't know any of that <eou> you feel you ca n't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them <eou> right <eou> unless <eou> for some reason orientals are very <eou> my good friend calls them pushy <eou> i call them very that <eou> they know what they want <eou> they go get it <eou> uh-huh <eou> in stores and so forth it 's wh- <eou> goal directed <eou> pardon me <eou> goal directed <eou> yeah <eou> in stores and things sometimes they can be very impolite because they get in front of you or they take something that you had in mind to get before you did <eou> oh <eou> i see <eou> just going for it they take it quickly <eou> uh-huh <eou> they do n't think anything of that <eou> i do n't <eou> that 's makes people resentful too yet they have a right to be here <eou> sure <eou> sure <eou> i know that <eou> uh-huh <eou> it sometimes it 's gets touchy <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'm sure it 's a lot different <eou> you 're from maryland you said <eou> yes <eou> what part of maryland are you from <eou> up in the gaithersburg area <eou> okay <eou> my sister used to live there in that area <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'm sure that it 's a lot different there <eou> it 's a lot different in iowa than it is here <eou> no <eou> is that right <eou> with some of the same problems that you 've mentioned <eou> i do n't know <eou> i guess i was n't involved enough to really stop to think about it <eou> uh-huh <eou> since i teach i see it <eou> i feel <eou> i love the example that most of these children give our american children <eou> yet i can see why some of the parents are fearful too <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's a kind of a touchy situation <eou> uh-huh <eou> i wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened it does n't happen that way all the time <eou> exactly <eou> exactly <eou> right <eou> right <eou> anyway <eou> it was good talking to you <eou> it was good to talk to you too <eou> i h- <eou> have a good trip in california <eou> okay <eou> have a good weekend <eou> all right <eou> thank you <eou> all righty <eou> bye-bye <eou>

probably not going to have the you think i would have <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's <eou> i was an interesting in that i think that he gave the american people a sense of the fact that wars are really run by politicians * [ [ i > it <eou> uh-huh <eou> i <eou> are you old enough to remember the war <eou> n- <eou> not much <eou> i 'm twenty-eight <eou> no <eou> i really do n't remember anything about it <eou> i guess i was about ten when it ended <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> i was born in sixty-two <eou> when did it end <eou> december seventy-two was when we bombed north vietnam and then they released the prisoners in early seventy-three in that time frame <eou> yeah <eou> i was ten <eou> i do n't remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in great detail <eou> i think the significant thing is today did you did you see barbara walters interview with schwartzkopf <eou> no <eou> i did n't <eou> i did read the book <eou> i ha- <eou> do ha- <eou> i have six years of college <eou> i did read and study about the vietnam war though <eou> i am pretty fa- <eou> i 'm more <eou> what 's your perspective on it <eou> familiar with it than <eou> mine <eou> i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that i think it was the right thing to do to try and not to take away to and to get rid of some of the atrocities that were going to <eou> i do n't know i do n't really <eou> i 'm tired of pacifist though * [ [ pacifist > pacifists <eou> on the other hand i 'm a pac- <eou> i 'm really struggling with it <eou> i believe that the real warfare is not with saddam hussein or the north vietnamese <eou> it 's in spiritual kingdoms and that the real warfare is done in your prayer closet on your knees <eou> in a way in a sense i 'm a pacifist <eou> yes <eou> i do n't think just lay back and not do anything <eou> i think lets go to war * [ [ lets > let 's <eou> let 's go to war praying <eou> let 's go to war for that way <eou> the difficulty i have is that are we our neighbor 's keepers <eou> uh-huh <eou> this is what i find particularly difficult in that if we see injustice and weather it 's in chicago * [ [ typo weather > whether or or dallas i think if we see it we see john wiley price hollering injustice i think that 's wrong <eou> uh-huh <eou> the question is was there injustice in vietnam <eou> was there injust in iraq kuwait * [ [ typo injustice <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> the difficult point is to where do we step in <eou> yeah <eou> the the other part is the when your when your when your looking at vietnam and you say is fifty-eight thousand lives worth it * [ [ 3 typos your > you 're <eou> uh-huh <eou> still have a problem with <eou> i have n't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this <eou> i know other christians would disagree with me <eou> my husband and i are kind of not even in agreement on this <eou> we do n't fight over it or anything <eou> how can <eou> the bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you <eou> it 's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind <eou> it 's like how can you <eou> i do n't know for me <eou> i do n't know i ca n't say that i agree with vietnam because how can you be gentle unto all men and then shoot them <eou> uh-huh <eou> could you stand there and watch them beat that guy <eou> if your brother or your sister were being beaten by the authorities do we step in <eou> uh-huh <eou> in some cases we would <eou> i think that 's what makes it so difficult <eou> yeah <eou> it is a difficult thing <eou> vengeance is mine sayeth the lord <eou> i will pay <eou> i think god is ultimately in charge of what goes on <eou> i know like now in china he did all these terrible things * [ [ probably mao <eou> they were terrible <eou> he was going to be accountable for them <eou> if you look back and you say wait a minute while he was in power he built roads he put in all the temples he unified the chinese language <eou> it was impossible for missionaries to accomplish anything in china because of all that <eou> even in north and south vietnam i bet you 'd see the same thing and that now he builds roads <eou> it <eou> he dropped dead twenty-five years premature he dropped dead <eou> something good did come out of that in that now you see what i mean if like now <eou> yeah <eou> the other difficulty is that it 's just if you take the to feed my sheep and the question is who are my sheep <eou> uh-huh <eou> the idea do we go out and feed these people when they 're hungry <eou> bless your enemies if your enemy is hungry feed him <eou> if he asks for your shirt give him your coat also <eou> if the the the south vietnamese they asked us to help them <eou> right <eou> is that right <eou> yes <eou> they did <eou> i think the biggest difficulty is that when your at an economy like south vietnam then reality the the poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes * [ [ your > you 're <eou> uh-huh <eou> the question is who was he going to pay it to <eou> yeah <eou> the communists are all alleged democrats <eou> uh-huh <eou> democratic formed government <eou> i think that 's i think i think that 's a little difficult part there <eou> i <eou> we did n't understand the culture <eou> we could n't <eou> we had a young lady that was fourteen that worked in the unit i was commander of that appeared to be eight or nine years old <eou> the people looked like children <eou> uh-huh <eou> you could n't imagine that one would would conceal a bomb and do these kind of things <eou> yeah <eou> i think socially it really destroyed a lot of the people that went over and saw these people <eou> you just could n't believe that they would be mean and and and drop bombs and kill people we would turn around and them * [ [ typo napalm <eou> uh-huh <eou> if <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think there was a lot of tearing of emotions <eou> i think that if anything that when he was saying the idea that we learned we learned a lot from vietnam <eou> uh-huh <eou> it was in general bad <eou> i do n't know the problem is now <eou> i 'm concerned a little bit that now that the gulf war is on that we 're going <eou> i think it was a good war <eou> it was okay to go beat up on people <eou> yeah <eou> i think we need a little more justice at home <eou> i 'm not sure how we get that <eou> wonder if there 's a connection there <eou> yeah <eou> again yeah <eou> i 'd say it is wrong to <eou> i 'm not saying president bush made the wrong decision <eou> i think i 'm lacking in my <eou> i do n't think i can come to a complete conclusion on how i feel about the vietnam war because i 'm going to interpret that through the bible <eou> i 've kind of always <eou> i 've been a christian five years <eou> i 've kind of avoided that those the war things and how god approaches that because i think it 's just now coming up to where i really feel like i need to decide what i feel <eou> the difficulty <eou> that was part of the problem when they went into the promise land * [ [ should be promised land that they they did n't destroy everybody <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> they left a woman and the sheep <eou> yeah <eou> you <eou> i think that 's one of those things when we get to heaven we 're going to ask god <eou> i know <eou> why did you do it that way <eou> again though the grace pushes you beyond the law you know what i 'm saying <eou> he did n't just say do n't kill your enemies <eou> not only do n't kill them bless them <eou> what can we do to rectify this situation <eou> that god would move in that sovereignly <eou> he would get the glory though no king no <eou> bush would n't because it would n't make any sense you know what are i 'm saying <eou> yeah <eou> it would look absolutely ridiculously stupid <eou> it would work out because if you follow the scriptural principals it 's going to work out because that 's the best way to do it * [ [ spelling = principle <eou> the thing is that then god gets the glory not a president not a king <eou> i think that 's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory <eou> i <eou> even at the local level when somebody 's assaulted what do you do turn the other cheek <eou> uh-huh <eou> n- <eou> i believe personally <eou> i ho- <eou> i woman always says my husband always goes three that i guess <eou> yeah <eou> if somebody broke in my house i would pray that i would have this faith to take authority over that <eou> i know people that have done that <eou> i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes and just say i bind you in jesus name <eou> your <eou> n- <eou> i just <eou> rebuke any enemy because i believe it 's a spiritual war that 's going on <eou> it 's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home <eou> that 's not normal <eou> there 's something going on there and that i would have discernment by the holy spirit to deal with pride over that <eou> do you see what i mean <eou> yeah <eou> the same in vietnam you would n't handle vietnam the same way you would handle saddam houssein * [ [ hussein <eou> i have a problem with all the killing <eou> i 'm not a new ager i do n't believe <eou> i am not for one world government <eou> i 'm not for all these new age things <eou> i i do n't have a problem with national identity <eou> i 'm an american <eou> having different nations and all of this <eou> i 'm concerned about the killing that went on there because i just feel like god has a better way to handle it than that <eou>
i 've had time to think about it because we 've had <eou> i- <eou> i- <eou> there 's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to i was thinking about a couple things and whether they are serious <eou> okay <eou> uh-huh <eou> some things are serious <eou> some are n't <eou> i guess the biggest thing that bothers me is <eou> uh-huh <eou> not the biggest thing <eou> one of the things that bothers me is the credit information situation that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any sort of credit extensive checks and things of that nature <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> when <eou> i do n't know if that 's an invasion of privacy simply i do t- i do feel it is <eou> i do n't know whether some of the questions they ask are legitimate because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> what 's scary is about two three four months ago in the sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here the dallas morning news <eou> uh-huh <eou> they showed a reporter and a copy editor how they went out <eou> they just took a fellow in john q public in dallas <eou> all they had was <eou> let 's see they had something like his birth date the street address <eou> they were n't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name <eou> it was very scary to see what they found out <eou> they were able to find out what liens he still had against two or three houses through two divorces children 's names locations <eou> it was really frightening <eou> i guess then it 's just the big brother concept of the fact that once you give your social security number there are people i guess who are actually collecting all this all the time <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> i understand <eou> i read the other day that these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone all they need now is your telephone number which i guess is involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> uh-huh <eou> i i feel that is an invasion of privacy <eou> it <eou> i do too <eou> yeah <eou> the other thing i do n't like is in terms of <eou> we just moved here from minneapolis <eou> to get the very nice townhouse that we 're in you were required by the property management firm that was representing a private landlo- <eou> yeah <eou> husband and wife owners who had never done this before <eou> they asked us for again an astounding amount of information <eou> what we really did n't have the same opportunity <eou> i guess that 's when i also get upset that if you 're going to do it then i want to do it too <eou> yeah <eou> exactly <eou> in terms of the credit <eou> yeah <eou> i know we 're also going through adoption now <eou> yeah <eou> in for an adoption <eou> after we gave our fingerprints to the f b i you look at each other you look at each other and say it 's too late now <eou> it 's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try <eou> yeah <eou> i have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me <eou> uh-huh <eou> go ahead <eou> b- <eou> i make my living by flying airplanes for a company <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> as an airline pilot i have to take random drug testing <eou> uh-huh <eou> it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time <eou> when i finish a certain flight on a random basis i have to have a drug test <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's without probably cause <eou> uh-huh <eou> a- in the end now they 've spent forty million dollars <eou> it is n't <eou> they 've found i think in pilots anyway of something like eighty-six thousand tests there 's only been three guys have come up positive <eou> one of them was a bad test <eou> positive for anything <eou> yeah <eou> i just started working for an electronics firm down here <eou> i used to be a reporter <eou> yeah <eou> now i 'm in corporate communications <eou> yeah <eou> part of that was as a new hire that i had to take a drug test <eou> drug test <eou> righ- <eou> i had never been asked that <eou> i thought i really did n't like it <eou> i have very mixed feelings about it <eou> i do n't disagree or agree with you <eou> yeah <eou> i think that it 's well <eou> you 're in that field <eou> i do n't know <eou> it 's <eou> we lived in minneapolis when the northwest airlines pilot in the dakotas <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> that hit the fan like <eou> you 're obviously aware of that <eou> yes <eou> i am <eou> i do n't know there should be some happy medium in terms of <eou> if they 're going to do random <eou> i do n't agree with random <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't see a problem with that <eou> i do think i see some level of necessity in something where people are transporting other people only because of the things you 've heard about <eou> the problem is <eou> the reason i feel that way even to a low degree is because it 's the old story the minority make it bad for the majority <eou> yeah <eou> i can understand the public 's alarm to it <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm not alarmed <eou> i guess having done this all my life i knew that there was n't a problem <eou> indeed it has proved out that way <eou> now try to get the damn thing repealed <eou> you ca n't <eou> yeah <eou> i know it 's <eou> i guess i feel bad because <eou> not only that <eou> in some of the instances you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints what what happens if you say no <eou> if you say no then you 're excluded <eou> i <eou> does n't seem the courts <eou> right <eou> right <eou> it 's a matter <eou> that 's exactly what it is <eou> yeah <eou> that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion <eou> if we did n't give it we would n't go to romania <eou> that 's right <eou> if <eou> you hate to say that <eou> that 's the way it is <eou> it 's my feeling also that that although <eou> i do n't know if it 's that serious <eou> that was part of the question <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do feel the courts have held up a great deal of our privacy particularly look in some of the in some of the <eou> uh-huh <eou> i notice in some of the sexual cases they 've held up a great deal of privacy which i support of course <eou> uh-huh <eou> it i guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that it does seem that we 've slipped and that 's eroded <eou> at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that it 's fair game <eou> t- <eou> you have to answer these questions of course <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do n't know <eou> i feel there has been an erosion <eou> i do n't really know how serious it is except i do n't like it <eou> in terms of the privacy yeah <eou> that in it <eou> also i agree with that <eou> in terms of the question in terms <eou> i worked in medical public relations for almost a decade <eou> that was pre-aids and all the other things that were probably there but just not labeled <eou> i have a real problem with medical professionals <eou> it goes back to the things like drug screening <eou> if it 's in any level even with the potential to endangerment <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think this is much stronger than pilots or train engineers being screened <eou> yeah <eou> the transmission of the aids virus <eou> i- <eou> i- <eou> that 's a real ethical problem <eou> i do n't have the answer <eou> i mean } i think of the young girl in florida who <eou> yeah <eou> that 's <eou> was she from your part of the country <eou> was she from <eou> what was that <eou> the young girl that contracted aids through her dentist allegedly <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> they proved it <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> i do n't know i do n't know if it 's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general or what <eou> it <eou> just take that step where now we feel there 's a need to do that <eou> the next thing you know then there 's always the need to go and inspect lockers of high school students <eou> uh-huh <eou> tha- <eou> yeah <eou> the <eou> i guess the question is <eou> the thing for me is who sets the parameters or who has the control <eou> yeah <eou> i guess so <eou> good luck to you <eou> you just moved to texas from minneapolis i do n't hold out much hope for you <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i think they 'll be a cultural shock <eou> i was based there a lot several times in the service <eou> i was absolutely flabbergasted at the <eou> in at least in criminal law some of the latitudes that the police had <eou> it 's ter- <eou> i 'm <eou> very seriously <eou> no- <eou> more than just seriously <eou> i 'm more than likely going to be going to law school in the fall <eou> oh yeah <eou> yeah <eou> if i figure out that 's still what i really want to do <eou> the things i 'm finding out are in terms of things privacy the way the law is interpreted presented <eou> yeah <eou> it 's no better than journalism except in journalism it 's words <eou> this is very frightening in that <eou> in texas they d- they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents whether it 's domestic or international <eou> they 're one of only five states that do not require a criminal investigation check <eou> yet if you 're caught with <eou> let 's just say that somebody who 's in ne- <eou> not us <eou> somebody who 's need of carting aluminum beer cans around <eou> they have n't touched them <eou> they have n't drank them <eou> they picked them up off the street <eou> they want to take them to a recycling resource for money or whatever <eou> they 've been going through a lot of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again because they 've been arresting people like that <eou> i do n't understand <eou> if you do n't <eou> if they do n't make a criminal check why do you have to be fingerprinted <eou> in our case one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level because you have to deal with the i n <eou> yeah <eou> because you have to deal with the imi- immigration service <eou> i see <eou> the state does n't require it <eou> that 's rather unusual is n't it <eou> yeah <eou> it is <eou> it 's <eou> the whole thing is <eou> again there 's no consistency <eou> in your <eou> in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly i ca n't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they ca n't do it at an interval <eou> i guess the extension of that is why not <eou> the next thing you know we 'll just stop a random amount of motorists <eou> if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street <eou> they do that in texas <eou> they do <eou> they do n't do it for drugs <eou> what they do is they check to see if you 've got current insurance <eou> they check to see if you 're permits are <eou> yeah <eou> there 's all sorts of scare tactics i guess to to invade our privacy <eou> yeah <eou> i know <eou> it 's kind of <eou> what 's the word i want <eou> i do n't <eou> it 's ju- <eou> to me it 's just frightening <eou> yeah <eou> the old <eou> i 'm old enough now where george orwell <eou> way past time <eou> i just going to say nineteen eighty-four is come and gone <eou> yeah <eou> it 's here <eou> yeah <eou> it 's exactly true <eou> i <eou> the computers of course helps that <eou> the computer abilities store that information <eou> look at what we 're talking now <eou> it 's <eou> look how we 're talking now <eou> you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger <eou>
okay i guess we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time <eou> uh-huh <eou> i basically read books <eou> uh-huh <eou> it is <eou> i do <eou> sometimes when everybody 's gone to bed my kids are in bed and my husband in bed <eou> i will just stay up and finish a book that i am <eou> i have about three books that i am going on <eou> i will work on one for a little bit and then the next one <eou> that 's just kind of <eou> that is pretty impressive to have three books going <eou> not always <eou> just sometimes <eou> yeah <eou> what what kind of books do you read <eou> just really different ones <eou> i have one that i was reading on raising your children and then another one on an autobiography and another one on like a crime story <eou> yeah <eou> a true crime story <eou> do you like those detective stories <eou> yeah <eou> this <eou> it was a true one <eou> it was just a little different though <eou> reading that one last night <eou> that is interesting <eou> i like to read also <eou> usually fall into one or two categories true science fiction fantasy on the one hand highly technical <eou> yeah <eou> like my husband <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> kind of one or the other <eou> you must work for t i <eou> yes <eou> yeah <eou> my husband does too <eou> yeah <eou> i am a computer scientist <eou> yeah <eou> i have a lot of other hobbies <eou> uh-huh <eou> really <eou> yeah <eou> i am kind of i guess what you would call a project person <eou> really <eou> yeah <eou> i love <eou> i have a shop <eou> when things break around the house i always try to fix them myself <eou> hobby <eou> it 's funny <eou> from the one stand point it is work <eou> it is a hobby too that i enjoy to do <eou> yeah <eou> to find broken <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> what kinds of things do you fix <eou> essentially anything you find in a house a stove or oven or a broken piece of porcelain or chipped tile on the floor just anything <eou> oh <eou> you have a shop <eou> it is not anything elaborate <eou> it is just a work bench and a gazillion tools <eou> yeah <eou> enough that again for anything in the house i could probably <eou> yeah <eou> you can fix just about everything and anything <eou> right <eou> that is great <eou> in the car <eou> i guess the car too <eou> yeah <eou> i think i probably would consider that a hobby <eou> although sometimes it gets to be excessive <eou> yeah <eou> that is pretty much like my husband <eou> he is pretty mobile in that area too <eou> he works on the cars <eou> he rarely takes them in <eou> yeah <eou> i <eou> he works on irons and all t vs and stuff too <eou> we rarely have to take those things in too <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> i think it <eou> not only can it be fun <eou> it can certainly help your finances <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> definitely <eou> do you have any creative or artistic hobbies <eou> not really <eou> during christmas i work on like holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things <eou> yeah <eou> good <eou> not really <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't necessarily either <eou> i can plink out a song or two on a piano <eou> oh <eou> i can <eou> i do n't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art <eou> i guess graphic arts is that what they call it <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i ca n't do any of that <eou> sweat shirts is certainly impressive <eou> uh-huh <eou> i belong to this organization if you have preschool children <eou> uh-huh <eou> every once and a while they will have a craft section for the moms <eou> yeah <eou> those are really neat <eou> we learn to do the transfer pictures on the sweatshirts transfer photos <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> those are really neat <eou> we learn different crafts like that <eou> i see <eou> that is neat <eou> yeah <eou> i guess you could consider that a hobby <eou> do you cook for a hobby <eou> do you <eou> no <eou> i cook dinner <eou> that 's not something you <eou> i do n't consider it a hobby <eou> i understand that <eou> i <eou> no <eou> i am not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately <eou> yeah <eou> i like to bake off and on <eou> usually once a week i will bake something <eou> it 's not anything elaborate <eou> right <eou> at least i do n't think it is <eou> yeah <eou> i think that still borders on hobby <eou> yeah <eou> probably the other thing i do which i am sure will sound horrible to you is i program for fun on the computer <eou> uh-huh <eou> i have little computer projects going on that i consider hobbies <eou> uh-huh <eou> drive my wife crazy <eou> oh <eou> good <eou> you have a computer at home <eou> i do <eou> yes <eou> good <eou> yeah <eou> in fact there is actually several of them here right now <eou> really <eou> not all of them being mine <eou> wow <eou> then you are busy <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> that is very good <eou> i wonder if you can construe raising children as being a hobby <eou> you know one of the books that i was reading <eou> i stopped because it was so <eou> it 's <eou> the book is so detailed <eou> uh-huh <eou> you have to <eou> sometimes i have to go back and read the page over again cause i did n't quite get it all <eou> it is so detailed <eou>
okay <eou> i have n't been in this situation yet <eou> my parents are not quite at that age yet <eou> i have n't <eou> they 're not quite elderly <eou> no <eou> i have n't really been in that situation although they are thinking about my grandmother that 's really about it <eou> uh-huh <eou> how about you <eou> have you been in that situation yet <eou> not for my parents <eou> i was around two sets of grandparents quite a bit <eou> we i put one grandfather in a rest home <eou> uh-huh <eou> that killed him <eou> did it <eou> yeah <eou> kind of <eou> there was some other things involved <eou> it <eou> before he was really active <eou> the <eou> there was some <eou> he lost his drivers license <eou> could n't get around and was n't able to do some things <eou> we ended up just having to put him in a rest home <eou> yeah <eou> he just kind of became a vegetable and died that was a long time ago <eou> no <eou> that 's sad <eou> yeah <eou> that was back in like seventy-three <eou> okay <eou> i think the way they did things were a lot different back then <eou> i 'm sure they were <eou> yeah <eou> my grandmother his wife we also put her in a rest home <eou> uh-huh <eou> she was in a rest home <eou> she was back out because she did n't really need to be there physical had a good physical therapist at that place they worked with her and got her walking and got her kind of taking care of herself she was able to come back home <eou> ah <eou> yeah <eou> { c and then } she had to go back in a couple of times <eou> oh <eou> mostly it was just because she kind of gave up <eou> they got her going again <eou> yeah <eou> i guess as far as looking do things with them and treat them like <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm sure it 's expensive <eou> yeah <eou> it is <eou> yeah <eou> it is expensive <eou> yeah <eou> my grandmother is not in a nursing home <eou> she 's in a <eou> uh-huh <eou> they 're apartments for senior citizens <eou> uh-huh <eou> she loves that because they arrange activities for them all day long <eou> uh-huh <eou> they have where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go <eou> she she really does love that <eou> uh-huh <eou> she 's just wondering what 's going to happen to me <eou> when she ca n't take care of herself <eou> i <eou> { d you know i guess it 's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she does n't need that <eou> uh-huh <eou> she 's kind of asking questions about what 's going to happen this ca n't last forever <eou> uh-huh <eou> does she have a <eou> is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to <eou> yeah <eou> she can go down to the cafeteria <eou> yeah <eou> she can <eou> uh-huh <eou> because i remember in her letters telling me she 'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat <eou> i 'm assuming it 's something like that too <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> i really like that concept <eou> uh-huh <eou> they have quite a few of those places like that here in utah <eou> couples can <eou> husband and wife can live there too or whatever <eou> i <eou> yet they have their friendships and relationships and the of getting together and eating together and all of that <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i think it really takes looking more at the people than even really the facilities <eou> uh-huh <eou> she lives by herself too <eou> she seems to like it <eou> uh-huh <eou> my husband 's grandmother is <eou> she lives in a house on her own <eou> she does n't really need the care or anything like that <eou> she has her own home <eou> she 's doing really well <eou> i 'm really proud of her <eou> she 's doing really well <eou> we have n't had to do anything <eou> then again she has a lot of support she 's got her mother in town too and things like that <eou> yeah <eou> yes <eou> i think that that 's the thing that 's a little bit scary a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it 's almost like <eou> that they say putting them out to pasture <eou> some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active <eou> yeah <eou> they wanted to do things <eou> they did n't want to go down and play bingo or play with the oranges <eou>
i 'll tell you my situation is i have an elderly grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home <eou> her son which is my father is also elderly <eou> this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years <eou> my father 's almost eighty <eou> my grandmother 's almost ninety-seven <eou> jeez <eou> it 's strange because it hit so close to home that my father 's an only child <eou> really me and my sister are the only ones that will deal with my grandmother <eou> she had many sisters <eou> a couple of them took care of her <eou> one her last sister died <eou> it was probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home because i was pretty much giving up my life my sister was and plus she was driving my father crazy <eou> she went through three live-in housekeepers <eou> she 's kind of cranky to get along with <eou> there 's nothing physically wrong with her except she 's very very old <eou> her personality is very grating <eou> i hope i do n't get like that when i get old <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm i have some great concerns about my parents and my relatives reaching that age <eou> around here where i live in maryland in the washington area there 's <eou> i used to live down in dallas there was just so many stories about rest homes where the people are being abused where the people are being kept in filthy conditions <eou> in fact here in baltimore they 've actually shut a couple of them down and taken all the people out of them because they were so bug infested and rat infested <eou> i <eou> it really concerns me that first of all that anyone could let someone live like that <eou> if you have to how do you make sure <eou> i 'm sure when you make your appointment and go by everybody puts on a happy face <eou> how are you sure that the home is really as good as it is because once you put someone into there they may not like the fact that they 've been put in there <eou> they might complain about the place all the time even though it 's the best place in the whole world they could be just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there <eou> yeah <eou> you do n't know if their complaints are legitimate <eou> yeah <eou> we do n't have that problem up here <eou> we might maybe in a rural <eou> maybe there 's a bad home in a rural area <eou> it would be a very small one <eou> the one my grandmother 's in is very hospital like <eou> there were some really nice ones here <eou> all the <eou> a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations <eou> this one is more or less for someone who 's poor and ca n't go there <eou> my father 's he 's no by no means wealthy <eou> he 's quite well off <eou> uh-huh <eou> he could easily have put her into a nicer home <eou> up here there 's waiting lists <eou> that was the first one that opened <eou> i suggested to him why do n't you change <eou> he said these people they are very nice to her <eou> he was saying his excuses if you move her some place else the people might not be so nice <eou> the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it 's a really trying job <eou> i go up twice a week to see my grandmother <eou> i know the staff very well <eou> they ca n't hide anything on you or anything like that <eou> uh-huh <eou> i have heard of really awful conditions especially down the southern part of the the country which is <eou> yes <eou> that 's true <eou> my grandmother 's <eou> last time my mother went down there to visit the place where my grandmother was staying at was so overrun with roaches that they went in and she had roaches crawling on her <eou> there were roaches even in her alarm clock <eou> that 's terrible <eou> yes <eou> it was absolutely horrible <eou> they took her immediately out of there <eou> they just threw everything away that she had from there <eou> they would n't even take the the dresser that she had that was her own dresser because it was just full of bugs <eou> they just left everything and bought her all brand new stuff <eou> they had called a home where they were on a waiting list to get into there and explained to the person that was in charge what had happened and that they had to take her out of the home because of the conditions <eou> amazingly enough the very next day they had an opening <eou> they put her into that opening <eou> that 's good <eou> is your grandmother impaired <eou> is she of alzheimer 's or something like that <eou> i 'm not sure what exactly is wrong with her <eou> up until nineteen eighty-two <eou> i 'm sorry not until <eou> yeah <eou> i guess it was around eighty-two eighty-three i found out i had a grandmother <eou> oh <eou> prior to that i was told that she was dead <eou> apparently what had happened was that i had a grandfather who put her into a mental institution <eou> that does happen <eou> yeah <eou> it was a real hush-hush thing <eou> yeah <eou> i was wondering why my mother always referred to his second wife as that hussy <eou> my neighbors across the street their mother was sick at times <eou> they could n't handle her <eou> they put her in a home <eou> the old frenchman he 'd get a little drunk look round at his kids you still need your mother <eou> that happens a lot when people are sick or they just real manic-depressants they end up being put in homes <eou> it 's like <eou> yeah <eou> that 's <eou> it 's <eou> i 'm really glad that i come from an area where there 's good people in the homes <eou> it 's just as <eou> it does n't matter if it is like you say the best place they still do n't want to go to these homes <eou> my grandmother 's real there <eou> she cries every day <eou> this has been over a year <eou> she tries to make me feel really guilty <eou> i have to put my foot down where my life begins <eou> if that was my mother i would really feel a lot more responsible <eou> i would probably take care of my mother <eou> i do n't really <eou> when my father when something <eou> if anything happens to him i do n't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i do n't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home <eou> hopefully that he can get along with in-house help <eou> he 's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day because i think that 's the best situation is when you get that old and you 've been independent your whole life you do n't want to go into a home because like i say my father 's eighty <eou> he 's really active <eou> he still has his driver 's license here <eou> you would n't believe what he does <eou> he actually tows cars <eou> as the years go on the tow trucks got better more easier <eou> he went out and bought himself a flat bed one <eou> he wo n't have to do very much work <eou> someone like that i really do n't want to see them go in a home <eou> he 's got two dogs that are his constant companions <eou> he always replaces them <eou> over the past thirty years i 've had about seven or eight different dogs all the time <eou> it 's like <eou> it 's <eou> dad 's got these two <eou> the old dies <eou> the young one goes for a while <eou> he gets another one <eou> i ca n't see him without his animals <eou> even though it 's very expensive to stay at home mentally it 's just the best thing for you <eou> yes <eou> i know <eou> when you get on in your years it 's the only thing you really have <eou> i 'm thinking when i get older i i think if brought all my precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home <eou> i do n't want to be selfish a burden on anyone <eou> that 's what i think because i see what my grandmother puts me through <eou> i 'm saying that when i get older i could probably make the best of this place <eou> of course it 's institutional food <eou> everybody hates it <eou> it 's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight <eou> yeah <eou> it 's a bad thing <eou> when they go into the homes they lose weight and because of the institutional food <eou> i think it 's fine <eou> my taste buds are pretty flexible <eou> here they 're always used to these old fashioned foods <eou> they 're very set in their ways and used to have what they could get at home <eou> now they 're feeding them quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat <eou> yeah <eou> just <eou> they do n't feed them the old people food the chicken and biscuits and things like that <eou> that 's the thing my grandmother really misses really growls about <eou> yeah <eou> my mother has made similar statements that she does n't want to become a burden to the family <eou> just put me out to pasture shoot me or something <eou> are the lines that come from her i tell her no problem mom always got a place for you <eou> oh <eou> yeah <eou> i know if if people would think ahead of time and do things like that like build the in-law apartment and have it on one floor and really easy access <eou> that 's what i 'm telling my father now <eou> he needs a new floor in his bathroom <eou> you can get in and out <eou>
there a lot of places to camp in dallas <eou> not necessarily in dallas <eou> it 's a very short drive to areas near here <eou> uh-huh <eou> do you do a lot of camping <eou> i have done camping in the past <eou> i ca n't remember when the last time i actually went camping was <eou> it was several years ago <eou> i did most of my camping in the mountains <eou> uh-huh <eou> that must have been fun though <eou> it is <eou> i enjoy hiking and camping <eou> we went to the <eou> i have some land there <eou> it 's handy to station yourself there on the land and then make trips up into the mountains for backpacking and hiking and overnight camping <eou> uh-huh <eou> that sounds fun <eou> do you do most of yours in tents <eou> yeah <eou> we 've done ours <eou> i 've only been camping twice <eou> wow <eou> one of them i do n't really consider camping <eou> it was on the edge of the lake <eou> it was at a camp <eou> i do n't like those camping grounds where you got r v beside you and then another people in tents beside you <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i just do n't care for that <eou> no <eou> i agree with you <eou> i think it 's much nicer when you can really get out far enough away where that you ca n't see people right out the window <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> it does n't <eou> we <eou> four years ago <eou> it was about four years ago my little boy was three months old <eou> the first time i left him we went overnight camping <eou> uh-huh <eou> we went and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake <eou> we had a ball <eou> uh-huh <eou> just sat out there with our <eou> we did n't even use tents then <eou> we just had sleeping bags and fire going <eou> uh-huh <eou> we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning <eou> does n't that always taste so much better when you 're out like that <eou> it did <eou> it did <eou> yeah <eou> i did n't even think about frying potatoes <eou> my sister-in-law she 's always done a lot of camping <eou> uh-huh <eou> she 's good <eou> she 'd think about bringing a rake so you can rake your area out <eou> yeah <eou> that 's right <eou> if you do n't you 'll find every rock on it [ when you put your when you put your bag down <eou> uh-huh <eou> sh- <eou> yeah <eou> she is always prepared <eou> she brought everything from like i said toilet paper to the rake <eou> the only thing we 'd had to do we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill <eou> uh-huh <eou> we we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped <eou> uh-huh <eou> we broke the i guess it 's the freezing component <eou> uh-huh <eou> we broke that out of there and put it over our hole <eou> what a clever idea <eou> yeah <eou> i would n't have thought about that <eou> it held our pan and the potatoes and stuff <eou> we had a good time <eou> that 's a good idea <eou> yeah <eou> we 're still waiting to go again <eou> uh-huh <eou> if you get a chance <eou> there are some really nice camping areas up in the wichitas which is in oklahoma and arkansas <eou> uh-huh <eou> arkansas <eou> i ca n't remember the name <eou> it 's on the oklahoma-arkansas border <eou> uh-huh <eou> it wo n't take but just a quick look at a map to find where those mountains are <eou> uh-huh <eou> i took a drive up through there as a matter of fact last september just took the drive through to see what was there <eou> uh-huh <eou> they have some wonderful camping areas there <eou> pretty <eou> beautiful beautiful country <eou> i love to swim <eou> i like to get out by a lake or a somewhere close where we can swim <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> lake tawakoni is a pretty nice place <eou> uh-huh <eou> we had a two bedroom mobile home there <eou> the boys still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and build a little fire and roast their marshmallows until the mosquitos bit and then they came in <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> how old are your boys <eou> they 're grown now <eou> they do n't go camping with you <eou> they go camping on their own <eou> oh <eou> once you start them they enjoy it all their lives <eou> yeah <eou> i have n't taken my little boy yet <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'm afraid to get him out <eou> he is so fearless it terrifies me <eou> uh-huh <eou> he <eou> do n't be concerned <eou> there 's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere <eou> think so <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's the water he 's not scared of <eou> he 'll go out into it until it 's up to his nose and then try to back <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's easy to keep him occupied though on land <eou> i know that i took my kids we 'd go out <eou> i 've them walk with me along the lakefront <eou> uh-huh <eou> we 'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell and finding the biggest shell <eou> we 'd hunt pine cones we climbed some pinon pines one year and gathered the cones so that we could eat the pine nuts <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out <eou> we + we searched for <eou> uh-huh <eou> we ate the wild plants <eou> we gathered wild berries <eou> it 's really <eou> yeah <eou> the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find <eou> if you know what to look for <eou> uh-huh <eou> i had my boys build their own little three leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark <eou> that sounds so neat <eou> we cooked in a pot <eou> i baked them a cake right there on a camp fire <eou> they were so impressed <eou> yeah <eou> i used a tire chain and the bottom of a dutch oven <eou> i 'm impressed <eou> my mother-in-law <eou> my <eou> they 've always done a lot of camping <eou> i grew up in louisville kentucky <eou> there was n't <eou> i do n't know <eou> we just did n't get out <eou> my mother and my father split up when we were young <eou> my mother was n't into that <eou> that 's who i stayed with <eou> uh-huh <eou> we did n't do much outdoors stuff except swimming <eou> uh-huh <eou> we went swimming a lot <eou> uh-huh <eou> my baby 's getting sick <eou> uh-oh <eou> i know <eou> if our time is up we can quit <eou> yeah <eou> i 've got to clean her up <eou> i 'm sorry <eou> appreciate it <eou> okay <eou> uh-huh <eou> i enjoyed talking <eou> thank you <eou> you bet <eou> bye-bye <eou> bye-bye <eou>
okay <eou> what is your opinion on drug testing <eou> i can see it in certain cases where somebody 's in a position that perhaps a lot of lives are involved like maybe pilots that fly jets <eou> maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people <eou> i could certainly see it being done <eou> in general <eou> whether companies want to do this <eou> i know that companies do <eou> like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested <eou> i know a couple of corporations that are doing that <eou> they kind of have gotten into the idea that let 's drug test them and let 's put them through rehab <eou> there 's got to be a limitation <eou> do we drug test everybody that comes in <eou> do we kind of say well you can be drug tested <eou> you look okay because you look this way <eou> you 're very conservative <eou> there 's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs <eou> the guy that does n't fit the stereotype of the conservative or whatever could be drug tested <eou> whether legal rights of that person <eou> i do n't know <eou> there 's certainly a lot of things to really consider when you get into drug testing people just at the work place unless of course like i said they have a large responsibility over a mass of people <eou> that 's about it <eou> yeah <eou> it it 's just not the com- <eou> you 're talking about company 's liability <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> if if the company is liable for something that that a employee does while under the influence of a drug then by all means they should have the right to to to + to minimize their liability <eou> sure <eou> sure <eou> i think that 's what companies are doing more and more because there are products that are out there <eou> there 's also the case about just health and welfare of the employees <eou> uh-huh <eou> if a company has a healthy work force their insurance rates are low <eou> exactly <eou> sure <eou> sure <eou> not only low there 's all sorts of a financial benefits associated with having people file fewer claims being sick <eou> sure <eou> exactly <eou> the only thing is <eou> the whole question that a that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy <eou> i do n't think anybody would argue with that <eou> exactly <eou> exactly <eou> the only thing is <eou> the one issue that i would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive <eou> right <eou> if they have had medications in the past let 's say once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe that week they take an advil <eou> the advil will apparently come out positive as if they smoked marijuana <eou> right <eou> there 's poppy seed type things <eou> i think that everybody is aware of that <eou> where 's the line where you say to somebody i 'm going to drug test you tomorrow <eou> please do not take these medications <eou> where 's how you can do it <eou> wel- <eou> the ques- <eou> right <eou> the question becomes what do you do about somebody who tests positive <eou> exactly <eou> d- <eou> that 's where the real sticking point comes in <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's not <eou> i do n't think there 's any problem with testing people <eou> sure <eou> it 's what do you do with the information <eou> sure <eou> exactly <eou> an- <eou> the only thing that i would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on <eou> let 's say you 've taken medication of some sort even though they usually have you at the time list what medications you 've taken <eou> let 's say you do come out positive <eou> you 've taken advil or any of the ibuprofen products out there <eou> you 've had a cold <eou> you 've been on medication or whatever <eou> you come out positive <eou> is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well this is kind of iffy <eou> are they really on drugs <eou> they on drugs <eou> you know what i 'm saying <eou> where there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person is on drugs <eou> right <eou> they may make up their mind that let 's get rid of this employee <eou> you know what i 'm saying <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> i think clearly the person who is the line manager <eou> uh-huh <eou> the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing <eou> that should go to an entirely different agency within a corporation <eou> exactly <eou> it 's a <eou> they can that the <eou> if it does come out positive the first time they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take <eou> you know what i mean <eou> it 's kind of like <eou> i think most people are aware at least now common knowledge is that <eou>
okay <eou> you ready to discuss the topic <eou> what 's the topic <eou> okay <eou> the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in america and how they relate or how they differ today than they were ten fifteen or thirty years ago <eou> okay <eou> you ready for that <eou> you bet <eou> okay <eou> i 'll let you lead out <eou> pardon me <eou> i 'll let you lead out <eou> okay <eou> there 's <eou> it 's kind of an interesting topic <eou> one that i think is quite fascinating because couple of years ago i guess <eou> not very long ago seemed like the whole world not just the united states but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in a very comfortable position so to say even though the cold war was in full swing <eou> you had the the russians against the americans the communists against the free world <eou> in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically not only on the political front but also on the economic front where couple of years ago america was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned <eou> now we 're having a very tough time in a recessionary period <eou> we 're also have a very humongous trade deficit <eou> that 's kind of frightening <eou> also a couple of years ago fifteen ten fifteen years ago an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life <eou> thirty years ago that was basically it whereas now we 're expected to have a career change every couple of years and possibly four to five career changes throughout our lifetime <eou> i think things <eou> there 's been an awful lot of social change lately <eou> we- <eou> i think one of the things that 's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that they seem to be economically driven also <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> if you look at russia and what 's happened over there i think the change in communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing <eou> of course i look at the economic problems in the united states right now <eou> one of the things you wonder is what that 's going to do to us <eou> true <eou> i think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things i think it 's great to even have three or four different careers in your life <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think it must have been terribly boring to go through your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years <eou> yes <eou> yes <eou> some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that aspects changing <eou> true <eou> true <eou> the uncertainty of whether you 're going to have a job is not as good <eou> the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs <eou> uh-huh <eou> do you think that 's good or bad <eou> i think it 's great <eou> you think that 's great <eou> yeah <eou> that 's some <eou> yeah <eou> because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position <eou> they 're very comfortable <eou> they lose the ability to learn <eou> they in a sense become unteachable <eou> they think they know all there is to know in the area set path and come in and put my time in from nine to five <eou> when that 's over with that 's it without even giving a second thought to advancing their education or getting extracurricular education <eou> i think that 's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also <eou> i think one of the problems with education as it relates to this though is that i do n't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes <eou> it just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes which i think is going to be a hard thing for people to face <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> i agree with that <eou> i agree with that <eou> i believe that an individual should really learn how to learn <eou> yeah <eou> learn how to adapt <eou> learn how to grow in their college or whatever education they might take <eou> that 's good <eou> that 's good <eou> there probably needs to be some training on how to to adjust to these changes as they come about <eou> if you look at the high unemployment rate right now <eou> you look at people who are in those situations i do n't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them even ideas of how to make those changes now <eou> uh-huh <eou> it seems to me that while those changes are taking place maybe we 're not well preparing people to make the changes with them <eou> yeah <eou> i read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now <eou> uh-huh <eou> that stress is a very prominent factor in the work place <eou> it affects <eou>
i 'm in <eou> like i said i 'm in minneapolis <eou> the big thing up here of course is the twins <eou> i imagine you ca n't escape it <eou> no <eou> it 's pretty pervasive <eou> it kind of goes into about all aspects of society i think up here <eou> i do n't know how much of the world series you caught last year <eou> that was a lot of fun <eou> of course it was fun for you <eou> to be honest with you i 'm not from minneapolis <eou> in fact i 've only been up here a few months <eou> i 'm going back at the end of next month <eou> to <eou> orlando florida <eou> really <eou> i 'm not exactly a real twins fan from birth or anything <eou> i was born and raised near miami and spent the last twenty years in dallas where the rangers played <eou> yeah <eou> oh <eou> uh-huh <eou> for the last roughly year i 've been in san francisco where there are two teams the oakland as and the san francisco giants <eou> right <eou> honestly i do my duty and watch the sports on the newscasts <eou> okay <eou> that 's about all the exposure i have to sports <eou> yeah <eou> i have n't followed it real closely at all except like i said last year when the world series rolled around i did follow that pretty religiously <eou> went out into the bars drank a beer watched the game had a good time that way <eou> uh-huh <eou> sure <eou> i guess the san francisco giants and the oakland as were the leading teams a couple of years ago <eou> is that right <eou> i th- <eou> i do n't know <eou> that 's sort of what i gather <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do n't know <eou> what is the prognosis for this year <eou> real good as far as i can tell <eou> people are pretty excited about it <eou> good <eou> i assume that means good for the minnesota <eou> yeah <eou> sorry about that <eou> yeah <eou> as far as the twins are concerned it seems to be real good <eou> my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago <eou> they won that one seven to one <eou> that 's pretty good i guess <eou> it looks like they 'll be doing pretty well <eou> are you still there <eou> yep <eou> okay <eou> i heard some noise on the line <eou> did n't know what happened <eou> i think a train went by <eou> okay <eou> all right <eou> i know a train went by <eou> i do n't know what the noise was <eou> i think it probably was the train <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know <eou> i i do n't even know who has been winning as far as the san francisco giants and the oakland as <eou> i think they both won their opener <eou> i sort of gathered that in my subliminal memory <eou> uh-huh <eou> maybe that has good tidings for their season coming up <eou> i 've got a friend that 's living in san francisco right now <eou> he 's doing the same thing i 'm doing which is basically an internship <eou> we 're both doctoral students <eou> he 's doing his with i b m <eou> huh <eou> i 'm doing mine with honeywell <eou> i think he kind of follows the sports <eou> i think he 's mentioned the oakland as a couple of times he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good <eou> uh-huh <eou> i guess they are different leagues <eou> is that right <eou> the as <eou> as far as i know <eou> yeah <eou> in the major leagues i guess there is a couple of different divisions <eou> of course there 's the minors <eou> i do n't know <eou> i guess i 'm one of those people that if i really made a concentrated effort i could really probably get into baseball <eou> uh-huh <eou> i was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago right after that game <eou> he offered to take me to one of the games because apparently he and four other people from honeywell had bought a row of seats for the home games <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> the thing is there 's like eighty-six home games per year <eou> there 's no way that you can ever use them all <eou> eighty-six <eou> eighty-six <eou> i was amazed to hear that <eou> huh <eou> that 's just the home games <eou> i thought it was a mistake <eou> he goes no <eou> they must play every day then <eou> yeah <eou> well just about <eou> yeah <eou> i mean eighty-six times two is a hundred sixty <eou> yeah <eou> that 's <eou> yeah <eou> that 's almost <eou> that 's over five months worth <eou> that 's a lot of baseball <eou> even if they play every day that 's over five months worth <eou> yo- if you consider it the season starts <eou> it 's <eou> the season started about a week and a half ago <eou> it ends with the world series which usually takes place i believe in december or january <eou> no <eou> yeah <eou> i think so <eou> it did last year did n't it <eou> was it november <eou> that was the super bowl <eou> maybe it was november i 'm thinking about <eou> i know it was doggone cold up here <eou> i do n't feel so bad <eou> i think you do n't know all that much more than i do about baseball <eou> i know for sure it was <eou> i see <eou> okay <eou> it was at least two months after i got up here <eou> really <eou> okay <eou> yeah <eou> it had to be november anyway <eou> i know the super bowl <eou>
okay <eou> are you a fisher person are you <eou> yes <eou> i love to fish <eou> great <eou> what kind of fishing do you do <eou> it 's mostly from the rivers and lakes <eou> in california <eou> and yes <eou> and from the banks <eou> i do n't like to go out on boats <eou> oh <eou> what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods <eou> it <eou> uh-huh <eou> oh <eou> i like it all except i do n't really care that much for the trout <eou> i think i had rather have a catfish than i would a trout <eou> i do n't blame you <eou> i grew up in nebraska and grew up cat fishing in the little blue river <eou> we moved to south dakota and did a lot of walleye fishing on the missouri river <eou> uh-huh <eou> now that we are down here i think a lot of people do some bass fishing and strip bass fishing <eou> i am sort of a catfish man at heart <eou> like in iowa and nebraska those little bullheads they look just like catfish <eou> yep <eou> yeah <eou> they do <eou> that 's what i mean cause i am from iowa <eou> oh <eou> we use to catch those little bullheads <eou> that 's <eou> they look just like baby catfish <eou> yeah <eou> did you get to go fishing very often <eou> yeah <eou> i like to fish <eou> the only problem is i just moved to texas <eou> it 's been a little over a year now i am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here <eou> uh-huh <eou> i really i have n't gone fishing for about two years now <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's driving me crazy <eou> one of these days i will go over to lake lewisville or lake ray hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while <eou> uh-huh <eou> you like to eat them after you catch them <eou> yeah <eou> sure <eou> there 's are a lot of people that like to go fishing <eou> mo- <eou> yeah <eou> most of the time if we catch something we 'll take it home and eat it <eou> you 're right <eou> i like to fish for trout <eou> they are really good fighters <eou> if i went to a restaurant that probably would n't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu <eou> yeah <eou> i know <eou> yeah <eou> do you just skin your catfish <eou> do you fillet them out <eou> how do you <eou> we skin them <eou> do you <eou> yeah <eou> okay <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> just cut their heads off and skin them <eou> i just flour them salt and pepper them and cook them <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't put that corn meal on them <eou> no <eou> that 's the way my mother taught me to fry them <eou> that 's how we do it too <eou> although we use to set some trout lines out <eou> we 've caught fourteen fifteen pound catfish <eou> sometimes those are good to do on a barbecue grill and just leave the skin on and do it with butter on on tin foil <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> the skin just basically scrapes right off <eou> wer- <eou> it really tastes pretty good <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't think i 've ever tried cooking those catfish quite that big <eou> there <eou> most of them are just the small pan frying ones <eou> yeah <eou> i am hoping one of these days i 'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on a rod and reel so far it 's just been on the trout lines <eou> would n't that be something <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> up in south dakota in the missouri river there we 've tied into a few northern pike <eou> they really <eou> in <eou> when the water is cold they are very slow moving fish <eou> in the summer time they 'll give you a run for your money <eou> uh-huh <eou> when you were <eou> when you did go fishing where did you go <eou> you moved there from where <eou> nebraska <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah in nebraska <eou> it was just like the rivers and the lakes i suppose <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> most of the time we just fished in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> a lot of them ended up being close to the river <eou> if the river every flooded then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits <eou> uh-huh <eou> we would do a lot of fishing there too <eou> south dakota did n't really have much for <eou>
okay <eou> you want to start by telling me what camping is to you <eou> do you backpack or hike <eou> a little bit <eou> nothing overly strenuous <eou> no <eou> the majority of my camping experience is a tent by the lake type situation or maybe a canoe trip or something like that <eou> no <eou> i 've never done a canoe trip <eou> that sounds interesting <eou> it 's <eou> we 've had a lot of fun <eou> i moved to dallas about five years ago <eou> we 've made three different trips since i 've been here of varying degrees of difficulty <eou> the last one we did was a canoe trip in arkansas <eou> the river it was up about three feet <eou> it was pre- it was pretty challenging <eou> i imagine <eou> we <eou> as far as the camping part of that we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and find a clearing in the woods and go for it <eou> they 'll fit in the canoe <eou> you go for days at a time <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it 's the <eou> that particular one was a two day trip <eou> what <eou> there 's a outfitter <eou> they haul you up to the headwaters come down about halfway and then you spend the night <eou> the second day head on down to the pool at the end of the river <eou> that sounds like fun <eou> yeah <eou> it really is <eou> the camping i grew up with was like tents and coleman stove type <eou> that just out in the woods <eou> i grew up water skiing <eou> i was from california <eou> okay <eou> we would go up to the sacramento river sloughs the delta there <eou> okay <eou> you just pick a campground on the river <eou> right <eou> right <eou> cooled off <eou> when i got married my husband had always backpacked <eou> okay <eou> we did that <eou> i guess we have n't done it since my kids were born about three years ago <eou> that was a new experience for me <eou> i enjoyed it <eou> i like being able to go back into the mountains or where the trail did n't necessarily lead and where you could n't necessarily pitch a tent <eou> i bet <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> that was interesting <eou> i have always wanted to do some white water rafting <eou> your canoeing kind of made me think of that <eou> yeah <eou> that was that 's always been our next step <eou> our little group of friends here we 've been kind of getting married off and what not <eou> do n't let that stop you <eou> yeah <eou> that <eou> it just puts a damper on things for a little while <eou> i know <eou> we 're starting to get everybody back together <eou> yeah <eou> we 'd like to do a float trip down like big bend area or something like that <eou> yeah <eou> you have n't done that before <eou> no <eou> no <eou> we have n't made that trip yet <eou> my parents were sailing this last year down off costa rica <eou> they took about two weeks and went into <eou> i do n't even know the name of the river there <eou> they went white water rafting <eou> mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience <eou> she said it was truly incredible <eou> i 'll bet <eou> yeah <eou> i <eou> there 's that sense of it you 're kind of scared that risk of what could happen and then the thrill of the excitement of doing it <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> exactly <eou> do you have anything planned for this summer <eou> not really just yet <eou> we 've <eou> i do have a little bit of property <eou> i grew up in south dakota <eou> okay <eou> i 've got a piece of property in minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet <eou> there 's a little lake up there <eou> a group of friends that i went to college with got together <eou> we basically own all the land around this little lake there <eou> it 's divided up into ten lots <eou> i imagine <eou> we 've got a private lake <eou> it 's completely undeveloped at this point <eou> that 's a possibility <eou> the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime <eou> it 's it 's about two hours north of minneapolis <eou> that sounds good <eou> yeah <eou> in fact <eou> i got married last summer <eou> that 's <eou> we ended up there for a couple days on our honeymoon <eou> we kind of took a tour of the united states for about a week and up through that area <eou> that sounds <eou> my wife 's real excited about it <eou> we 're going to hope to get up there sometime early eno- <eou> last year it was the end of july <eou> it was a little too late for the fish <eou> hopefully get up there early enough to get into some of the fish and the the good weather and what not <eou> we 've been wanting to start camping again this year too <eou> my oldest child is a girl was born three years ago three and a half <eou> uh-huh <eou> i have a little one that just turned two <eou> we are in the process of potty training <eou> i did n't want to go camping with diapers <eou> gosh <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i <eou> at a time when they 're afraid of their shadow all they need is some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent <eou> they 'd be awake all night <eou> that 's right <eou> i think with him almost potty trained and she 's not afraid of her shadow anymore i 'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we 'll be able to go this summer even if it 's like over to rio dosa for a couple of days or something to get them used to it and get them started with little back packs of their own and things like that <eou> sure <eou> right <eou> you bet <eou> yeah <eou> we 'll that <eou> there 's a lot of places with nature trails things like that where they could learn a lot too <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's true <eou> it 's like this is this is what a pheasant looks like <eou> now we 'll go look for one <eou> i would need that before i could teach them <eou> yeah <eou> that 's <eou> everybody might learn something that way <eou> yeah <eou> that 's <eou> there 's an awful lot of things set up just anything you want to do <eou> like you say it can be a water ski trip or fishing trip or just a sightseeing bird watching hunt with a camera type of thing <eou> there 's a lot of different opportunities for things like that <eou> it 's a lot of fun <eou> it really is <eou> hello <eou>
jan how do they recycle in texas <eou> i <eou> the biggest way it 's going right now } most of the grocery stores have got things set up where you can bring in your plastic and your cans and newspapers <eou> uh-huh <eou> they 've just got different barrels setting out <eou> or whatever they 're called gondolas <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> yeah is it all voluntary <eou> they 've got them set outside <eou> yes <eou> it 's all voluntary <eou> they do have some places where you can take things and get cash <eou> right <eou> uh-huh <eou> they just want to help recycle which is what we do <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> we <eou> probably the only thing sometimes we 'll take the cans in <eou> we let the kids get the money for that <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> there 's a lot of projects where the boy scouts and things that will collect your cans <eou> f- <eou> right <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true <eou> that 's really the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating <eou> uh-huh <eou> i guess i <eou> i guess it depends on your landfill space <eou> uh-huh really <eou> i know i <eou> we 're in maryland <eou> my <eou> i from pennsylvania * [ [ missing copula <eou> my parents are forced recycling <eou> yeah <eou> wow <eou> pennsylvania ohio and new york are some of the <eou> they 're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones <eou> yeah <eou> it 's really hard on them <eou> up here in maryland though we 're just in a voluntary recycling stage right now <eou> my wife and i we save our bottles <eou> we save our newspapers <eou> we save all our plastic and all of our tin cans <eou> just like you say we go to a community area where they have it set up <eou> we dump them off there <eou> it 's vol- <eou> yeah <eou> it 's still voluntary though i think we 're supposed to have something implemented by nineteen ninety-three though where some aspects will be mandatory <eou> you say it is all voluntary <eou> do they <eou> will it be mandatory <eou> uh-huh <eou> is it all <eou> is there any place at all where you do get cash for this stuff <eou> is it all <eou> mostly just the cans <eou> okay <eou> i <eou> yeah <eou> that 's <eou> most of the time like i said that 's a sort of fund raiser things that the schools do or that the boy scouts do or whatever <eou> right <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true <eou> that 's <eou> cans are the only thing i think you really get money for <eou> they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers and stuff like that <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think a lot of people like i said are more concerned with right now the aspects of saving the earth <eou> right <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> i think that 's mostly <eou> we <eou> even before <eou> as soon as the community said we 're going to put up bins for recycling we automatically started doing it it 's one of those things <eou> right <eou> just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be separated <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's <eou> i tell you it 's kind of funny now even at t i i do n't <eou> do you work for t i <eou> no <eou> huh-uh <eou> okay <eou> at t i they 're doing recycling <eou> for a long time they did n't do this <eou> now they 're recycling cans and paper <eou> we have separate bins separate wastebaskets in our offices for paper <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> they <eou> it 's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees it 's really <eou> right <eou> i ca n't believe that because they 've got it all posted all over the place how much they 're saving and how w- <eou> yeah <eou> how well they 're doing <eou> yeah <eou> we do <eou> i i work in a speech interface lab at a at a college <eou> okay <eou> we do basically the same thing <eou> the state of maryland has asked all the colleges and universities and some of the large organizations if they would definitely recycle their office paper <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> in the giant bins around <eou> it 's surprising how much you never realize because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage can every night <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> yep <eou> you do n't notice until you start leaving <eou> they do n't pick up your recycling until it 's full you just ca n't believe how much paper that you <eou> right <eou> i know <eou> reams of paper come out of an office every day to recycle <eou> you think about the waste even <eou> uh-huh <eou> cost wise and saving trees and stuff like that <eou> right <eou> it 's just amazing the difference <eou> yeah <eou> i think hopefully if <eou> i guess a lot of the large organizations probably t i did they advertise on television how successful they are <eou> n- <eou> i have n't seen anything <eou> yeah <eou> that does n't mean that they do n't <eou> i do n't watch much t v <eou> yeah <eou> i have n't really seen anything advertise publicly <eou> uh-huh <eou> and like i said they do a lot of internal advertising on that kind of stuff <eou> internal <eou> uh-huh <eou> i have n't seen anything <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't see a lot of t i advertisements on t v anyway <eou> i think they advertise more other places where they 're not located i do n't see a lot of advertisements for t i <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> that would probably be true <eou> yeah <eou> i know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television <eou> they 'll come up and say <eou> they 'll show you to encourage recycling <eou> they 'll say <eou> right <eou> here those of us that power which is our power company that <eou> uh-huh <eou> we now recycle forty-five percent of our solid waste <eou> right <eou> they <eou> that <eou> we do this for the community <eou> they put those on <eou> i think we 're probably reaching a successful stage and just with voluntary i think <eou> right <eou> even in the kid 's schools they do things to try and recycle <eou> uh-huh <eou> i know my kids if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say look at that somebody is not saving the earth <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> the kids they really try to educate all ages <eou> it 's good to start the kids real young on <eou> i think so too <eou> yeah <eou> it 's like nobody was concerned about it <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> we were n't concerned <eou> it 's like <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true <eou> it 's like all of a sudden when there 's noticeable things saying we 're ruining the earth <eou> huh <eou> now everybody is doing something about which is good <eou> uh-huh <eou> how come we were n't doing this twenty years ago <eou> yeah <eou> i think really probably what hit peoples i know that here up in the the new englands area and also in pennsylvania ohio and new york all of a sudden we 're out of landfill <eou> uh-huh <eou> they 're saying we estimate this landfill be ov- will be full in two years unless we cut back <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think that that became <eou> that all of a sudden really hit home that there 's no longer landfill space in some of the more crowded states <eou> this is <eou> what <eou> no other state <eou> i 'm sure texas probably still has some landfill space <eou> they 're not going to voluntarily say ship your garbage here <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true <eou> it 's really tough <eou> i think that it really surprises me because of the cost savings <eou> this is such a tremendous amount of cost savings <eou> uh-huh <eou> why <eou> i ca n't understand why nobody saw that before <eou> i even not + even the aspects of not saving the earth <eou> uh-huh <eou> { e i mean } it 's so cost <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> in some ways i guess it does n't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it because i know that in pennsylvania they require them to put their newspaper for recycling <eou> the de-inking process that they use to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused is very expensive <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> oh <eou> also it produces a waste a liquid waste that they do n't know what to do with yet they still have cost efficient yet <eou> oh i see <eou> okay <eou> is not real cost efficient <eou> okay <eou> okay <eou> yeah others like tin cans and plastics are really efficient they melt on quickly just because of the heating and things glass <eou> i understand that though <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> and glass <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> i- <eou> it really is surprising that people have n't noticed it before <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> even <eou> i noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil <eou> uh-huh <eou> that kind of surprises me <eou> because once oil gets so thick and yucky you 'd wonder how they could clean that up enough to use it again <eou> yeah <eou> they can <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do n't know how cost efficient that would be i guess <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know either <eou> that 's <eou> i know that though all those petroleum products though are so terrible for the water table <eou> uh-huh <eou> they really pollute quickly <eou> one <eou> uh-huh <eou> wow <eou> it 's one of those things that they really <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i know <eou> yeah <eou> how terrible that is <eou> we 'll have to keep our eyes on all that i guess <eou> really <eou> uh-huh <eou> i know i really <eou> i do n't know <eou> i think that i think that they really are doing a good thing now <eou> i hope it keeps <eou> i 'm sure we 'll keep up <eou> yeah <eou> i agree <eou> i think it 's really catching on <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think that <eou> i 'm not sure if it <eou> i do n't know <eou> i think it 's a good idea to make it mandatory <eou> i do too <eou> it <eou> because we were asking some people that live in north dakota are you recycling <eou> they said we 're not forced to do it yet <eou> no <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do n't know <eou> i think that if the people are not forced to do it they may not { d you know } <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know <eou> i think a lot of people still will <eou> i know that it 's really funny <eou> my parents are forced to do it <eou> they <eou>
okay <eou> do you have any favorite teams <eou> i kind of like them all <eou> i played for about eighteen years all the way through college and then kind of hung them up after college <eou> i was going to say you played pro ball <eou> right <eou> no <eou> not quite <eou> not quite <eou> made it <eou> yeah <eou> made it all the way through four years of college playing ball <eou> oh <eou> yes <eou> i 'm a met <eou> i 'm one of these people who 's actually a die hard mets fan and an avid yankee hater <eou> i think it 's one or the other is n't it <eou> yeah <eou> it 's <eou> i i find it very strange <eou> more people <eou> real met fans do n't like the yankees <eou> real yankee fans do n't like the mets for some reason <eou> yeah <eou> i never quite found a new york fan <eou> i always found a fan of one the other <eou> that of course means that when it comes to the american league my favorite team is the red sox by default because i went to college also in boston <eou> okay <eou> i see <eou> yeah <eou> i like the <eou> i guess if i had to pick a favorite team any more as well as <eou> i kind of grew up rooting for philadelphia <eou> oh <eou> i 'm from new jersey originally <eou> yeah <eou> that 's sort of close enough <eou> yeah <eou> we were thirty miles south of them <eou> you were pretty close <eou> right down the river <eou> what are the mets going to do this year without strawberry <eou> i do n't know there 's a part of me that says that i 'm sort of glad strawberry went away <eou> when he sort of went away i started thinking he was performing fairly well <eou> he really was n't worth the baggage <eou> yeah <eou> i think they 're okay <eou> i think they 're <eou> i think they have enough people who are who are still in their prime <eou> uh-huh <eou> certainly if you look at them compared to let 's say eight years ago or something they 're they 're they 're they 're sort of in good standing whereas i certainly do n't think they 're the eighty-six team any more <eou> yeah <eou> i was going to talk to you about that eighty-six team <eou> yeah <eou> i <eou> that was the year they beat houston in extra innings <eou> right <eou> right <eou> they beat houston in extra innings <eou> they won the series bye-bye sort of a sneaky route against boston when there was the ball that was sort of hit to buckner <eou> yeah <eou> i felt real bad about that <eou> what can you do <eou> the guy 's making millions <eou> he ought to be able to perform <eou> right <eou> that 's right <eou> he he was supposedly <eou> there was something wrong with him at the time <eou> i <eou> his knees were bothering him <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> i understand that <eou> i say if the guy ca n't play you do n't blame that <eou> hit it to him <eou> you blame the team for putting him in <eou> yeah <eou> for having him out there <eou> that 's right <eou> sure <eou> i i was i was also i was in school at boston at the time <eou> boy <eou> i <eou> it was actually wonderful because where i was they were half met fans and half sox fans <eou> yeah <eou> i think we were all pretty much astros fans in the national league championship series <eou> oh <eou> there 's two fellows from brooklyn <eou> they were they were pretty much without having to say they were pretty much mets fans <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i guess they must have been scared after the <eou> no <eou> not really <eou> they were pretty much thugs <eou> they were n't scared very much <eou> that 's good <eou> they 're brooklyn boys i guess <eou> yeah <eou> you do n't expect them to be much of anything but thugs <eou> really <eou> yeah <eou> i was i was also born in brooklyn <eou> i can call myself a brooklyn thug although i 'm really not <eou> okay <eou> okay <eou> i 'm not to say that all folks from brooklyn are thugs <eou> these two were definitely thugs <eou> they were from brooklyn <eou> i 'm kind of hoping <eou> i i guess any more <eou> i pretty much pull for the rangers though <eou> they 're they 're they they have i think they have the best facilities in the major leagues <eou> yeah <eou> i love going to watch a game in arlington stadium <eou> it 's great <eou> that 's <eou> i think i make something because i think <eou> in as much as sort of fan support helps <eou> yeah <eou> it 's good to have <eou> the only problem is it 's not large enough <eou> it only holds about <eou> i think they when ryan struck out his five thousandth player they squeezed about forty thousand people in there <eou> yes <eou> it is kind of small <eou> yeah <eou> they they have plans <eou> the owner tried to move them to florida <eou> right <eou> they ended up sticking around in arlington <eou> they 're going to build a new stadium in arlington as a matter of fact not even in dallas <eou> that 's great <eou> that 's something that we 're looking forward to <eou> yeah <eou> that 'll be nice <eou> that i think tends to keep <eou> i think stadiums work tend to keep people happy <eou> case in point toronto <eou> yeah <eou> exactly <eou> yeah <eou> have you seen a game up there <eou> i have n't been to any toronto games yet <eou> boy i saw it i was up there on business last june and watched a game in the sky dome <eou> it was just phenomenal <eou> that 's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums i think <eou> of stadiums yeah <eou> to get up there <eou> the best i 've been up here so far in up state new york is is rochester red wings game <eou> uh-huh <eou> is rochester <eou> where is cornell university <eou> cornell is in ithaca <eou> ithaca <eou> yeah <eou> cornell is about somewhere about two and a half hours south and east of us <eou> okay <eou> if you know where lake ontario is sort of <eou> yeah <eou> rochester is right on the shores is n't it <eou> yeah <eou> we 're about ten miles south of lake ontario <eou> yeah <eou> okay <eou> whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion because they built it far enough from the city that it actually could n't be a port city <eou> they <eou> they say that from that space needle up in toronto you can see the lights of rochester on a clear night <eou> i had n't actually known that <eou> yeah <eou> we have our own triple a team here <eou> yeah <eou> the redwings they 're a farm team for the orioles <eou> yeah <eou> okay <eou> yeah <eou> everybody hopes that they go all the way around here <eou> there 's the <eou> they 're the big team in rochester <eou> those games are fun to watch <eou> you you watch those games <eou> yeah <eou> i <eou> we we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they 're fun <eou> yeah <eou> lots of really big <eou> lots of local fans small stadium <eou> they 'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> especially <eou> i 'll make a day game or something <eou> yeah <eou> they really seem to <eou> people really get into it <eou> i again i ca n't make any predictions about them <eou> yeah <eou> we used to like watching <eou> my folks lived down in beaumont <eou> on the campus of lamar university they used to house the beaumont golden gators who were a double a team for the padres i think <eou> they were fun games to watch <eou> those are i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes <eou> someti- <eou> there 's definitely a lot more hitting <eou> yes <eou> it 's true <eou> one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are <eou> yeah <eou> i guess when you start pitching real well move them up <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> as far as the major league teams i do n't know the rangers have been <eou> every year they always knock on the door early and then just go into their skid about the end of june <eou> they 've got so much young raw talent <eou> it 's just amazing <eou> they just have n't been able to put anything together <eou> the way i see it is <eou> i can use a met analogy here <eou> uh-huh <eou> if you 'll think back a few years to when the mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but were n't very sort of well trained <eou> yeah <eou> back to maybe eighty eighty-four or eighty-three or eighty-five when they were n't quite the eighty-six team that that they were <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> i <eou> that probably gives the readers a good shot for you this year or next year if i think the young talent really just has to build itself up <eou> yeah <eou> they 've been young for a while <eou> they 're almost starting to age a little bit here <eou> i just <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> they really hurting pitching wise <eou> they 've got ryan <eou> who knows what he 'll be able to do <eou> he 's been <eou> last year he started having some nagging injuries it 'll be interesting to watch <eou> right <eou> i hope to get up there <eou> we usually try to get to opening day game <eou> there 's several guys from our church try to go up there <eou> that must be nice <eou> yeah <eou> i guess we 're maybe a hundred fifty miles south of dallas <eou> no <eou> not too bad <eou> it takes about two hours two and a half hours to get there <eou> yeah <eou> it takes me a good seven hours to get to shay stadium <eou> i do n't know <eou> that 's probably because of the roads <eou> you just do n't have <eou> we 've just got a freeway <eou> we just get right on the freeway and just go north <eou> yeah <eou> we can i can take a highway the whole way down <eou> it 's some + it 's it 's almost four hundred hou- <eou> it 's so crowded up there <eou> it 's almost four hundred <eou> barring traffic it 's four hundred hours <eou> four hundred mil- <eou> four hundred hours <eou> right <eou> four hundred miles barring traffic <eou> golly <eou> it 's it 's it 's a heck of a drive <eou> we are substantially north of new york enough that we do n't get to go play too often <eou> yeah <eou> you 're like a boat ride from <eou> how far is it across the lake to canada <eou> toronto <eou> toronto <eou> toronto 's only about two hours <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> toronto i want to go see <eou> do you drive there <eou> do you take the ferry or what <eou> i can <eou> i 've driven <eou> i 've heard about the ferry as well <eou> yeah <eou> have n't taken it yet though <eou> have you taken it <eou> yeah <eou> it 's a beautiful city <eou> yeah <eou> i really love <eou> i think that 's one of the most enjoyable things about being up here <eou> i 'm only up here for school <eou> uh-huh <eou> you go back to new york after school <eou> no <eou> probably south maybe texas <eou> really <eou> some place south and warm <eou> i do n't <eou> i 'm not a big cold fan <eou> what kind of weather are you having right now <eou> right now we 're actually having <eou> it 's getting nice <eou> it was in the high fifties today <eou> three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm <eou> boy <eou> yeah <eou> we 've been up in the seventies eighties even up in the nineties a couple of weeks ago <eou> that 's great <eou> about that same time branches were falling off everywhere <eou> we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks <eou> golly <eou> because of the ice <eou> it did n't make the national news too much which i find really weird <eou> we were <eou> all schools were closed for over for a week <eou> golly <eou> there were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive <eou> illegal <eou> yeah <eou> they had so many power lines down <eou> yeah <eou> many things like that <eou> they were <eou>
all right <eou> okay <eou> what do you think of the giants <eou> i like the giants <eou> they got <eou> i probably did n't get into baseball until maybe three years ago really <eou> yeah <eou> i just like the giants <eou> i do n't know why <eou> i really got into them <eou> i read dave dreveki 's book his autobiography <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> was n't that something of him <eou> yeah <eou> that was incredible <eou> yeah <eou> that 's really a <eou> really proud of him though the way he 's <eou> the way he handled that entire situation there <eou> yeah <eou> really <eou> i just think the giants have a good team <eou> they got all <eou> they 're they 're real balanced out <eou> they got real good pitching <eou> they got the hitting to go along with it <eou> yeah <eou> i just do n't understand why they 're not right up there on the top <eou> yeah they need that i think they just need that one element to push them over the top <eou> i do n't really know what it is <eou> every team that 's really good seems <eou> like the as they had they just had it all that one year <eou> yeah <eou> i was mostly an as fan <eou> i had been to more games at the as than i have in the giants because i lived in oakland for some time <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i still like the giants though <eou> yeah <eou> if you 're a fan you got to stay with the team any way good and the bad <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> it 's kind of hard <eou> i still basically the <eou> me and all my friends around here since we do n't have anywhere <eou> we can go to the astros or the rangers teams <eou> since no- <eou> of me and my friends are really like either one of those teams <eou> we <eou> uh-huh <eou> about the most baseball we get is t v we play it on nintendo <eou> we play r b i baseball on nintendo that 's small town trying to make it through not being around it really <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> i prefer football over baseball <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> so do i <eou> baseball is still <eou> it 's <eou> you got to do something when football ai n't on <eou> hot dogs baseball and apple pie <eou> yeah <eou> exactly <eou> this is america <eou> yeah <eou> what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams <eou> i do n't know it 's hard to say <eou> i have n't really <eou> you have to just keep up with everything in the off- season <eou> it 's kind of hard to do <eou> at least you have to read the paper and sports illustrated and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and all that <eou> i know <eou> like i say if they can get that one element that they were missing i think the giants can do it <eou> yeah <eou> the giants are <eou> they just <eou> i do n't <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't really know about the as <eou> they kind of <eou> yeah <eou> makes you sick does n't it <eou> yeah <eou> you hear what you hear what he did <eou> yes <eou> he ramming his wife 's car <eou> i was like yeah <eou> he 's like a little bitty kid <eou> yeah <eou> he 's just a a little boy with a lot of money <eou> yeah <eou> that 's just <eou> yeah <eou> i guess the giants might move away from san francisco it sounds like <eou> yeah <eou> i 've heard talk about that <eou> they wo n't be that far away <eou> san francisco will be hurting anyhow <eou> yeah <eou> they 're not going to be happy about it <eou> i hope they can do good <eou> that 's just <eou> i think they 're a good team that just need that one little thing to push them over <eou> i do n't know exactly what it is <eou> they got <eou> they 're pretty balanced out all the way through <eou> it just might be the drive more than anything else <eou> uh-huh <eou> they probably just need something to push them because that 's the only thing i can see that 's holding them back is the ambition to do it <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> somebody basically <eou> maybe they just need everybody to tell them they ca n't do it <eou> maybe that 's what some teams need <eou> look at the twins going from worst to first <eou> i know is n't that something <eou> yeah my roommate 's a twins fan for forever <eou> i could n't believe that <eou> he had his year this year <eou> yeah <eou> i just it <eou> we got into that a whole bunch <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> that was a series to remember for sure <eou> uh-huh <eou> i saw all seven games of that <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i could n't believe that <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't <eou> there was braves in that chanting that they had <eou> that would drive you up a wall <eou> yeah <eou> they <eou> every team with the indians been doing that now <eou> i ca n't figure out why <eou> you have to figure out why they 're all doing that i 'm like it 's does n't work it 's obvious it does n't work because the braves did n't win <eou> yeah <eou> you 're right <eou> why keep on doing something that did n't work i do n't know <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i was kind of surprised that we were going to talk about baseball <eou> i get a woman 's voice i was i was thinking uh-huh <eou> i talked to a guy named vinny last night about fixing your car <eou> really <eou> yeah <eou> i got a call the other night about fixing your automobile up <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> baseball 's baseball <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> it 's kind of <eou> i do n't know it 's kind of odd they pick <eou> do you pick the topic or does the computer <eou> no <eou> they give you a list of things that you want <eou>
steve this is <eou> like i mentioned brian and i guess we 're going to want to be talking about child care <eou> do you have any experience in finding child care <eou> ourselves we have i guess never had to look for child care <eou> uh-huh <eou> our kids are now fourteen and eighteen <eou> you go back those many years and we did n't do it very much <eou> uh-huh <eou> i guess we were in a situation where we did n't need to be looking at two family income at the time <eou> uh-huh <eou> our kids were older <eou> i 've had to deal with friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing <eou> right <eou> it <eou> my involvement has n't been direct <eou> still have been certainly exposed to criteria people are using <eou> uh-huh <eou> how about yourself <eou> we 're kind of lucky <eou> i 'm i 'm working <eou> my wife is n't working <eou> she is taking care of the kids also <eou> we have n't had to look for child care either which has been very nice <eou> i do have like you mentioned a lot of friends a lot of co-workers and associates that are looking for child care <eou> some of the things that they 're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care what kind of guidance counselor to student or adult to child relationship <eou> how many <eou> right <eou> you do n't want to have thirty or forty kids and only one adult <eou> then something happens and the adult would n't be able to accommodate or take care of the kids very well <eou> right <eou> they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time <eou> depends also upon the level of the child <eou> we we take a very close look at finding a preschool a good preschool for our kid <eou> uh-huh <eou> i kind of relate that to that in making sure that the teachers are very well educated themselves they have a good curriculum and that they 're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them <eou> it 's very important i feel that the kids interact with other children also <eou> it 's a good way to develop relationships with other kids their age and get to know and work with kids <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know i guess we 're kind of in the same boat <eou> we have n't had to look very carefully for child care <eou> yeah <eou> i kind of think that some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care <eou> uh-huh <eou> even here i guess we have in one sense two forms of child care <eou> there 's where individuals will in one primarily babysit children in their own home <eou> uh-huh <eou> that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to maybe seven or eight children <eou> uh-huh <eou> otherwise there will be <eou> the majority are co-operative day-cares <eou> people form a co-op and parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours <eou> frequently they will hire staff to be at the day-care <eou> the emphasis is primarily someplace for the children to be <eou> uh-huh <eou> at the same time there 's some fairly good training programs and some of them formal two year programs <eou> right <eou> right <eou> that <eou> there is some definite creative play good social interaction that kind of thing <eou> i think it 's important like you mentioned that 's a good idea on the parent co-op because i 'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids <eou> i do n't want to just take them to somebody i pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere <eou> i want to trust the people <eou> yeah <eou> you hear on the t v and you read the newspaper quite often of people that do n't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of <eou> hope to never get into that situation where we have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children <eou> hope that we can stay in this situation for awhile <eou> yeah <eou> we 've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here <eou> uh-huh <eou> i guess it are <eou> it 's typically whether it 's been child care in a home or in a larger situation where actually it 's more of an institution <eou> uh-huh <eou> you 've actually got children that most people would consider problem children <eou> it 's more of a group home rather than actually day-care type of facility <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true <eou> that 's true <eou> steven it 's been <eou>
okay <eou> i do n't have any i guess definite views about elderly care <eou> the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see where elderly people are abused and things like that <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> i think that 's one thing that i would look at if i was putting my grandmother or my mother in some sort of home <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i agree with you <eou> i <eou> a group that i 'm a part of goes once a month to they call it the heritage house <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's a nursing home for elderly people <eou> uh-huh <eou> this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i watched <eou> the interesting thing was i watched this particular one change hands <eou> it started out just being a terrible place for the people <eou> uh-huh <eou> a new company bought it and came in and remodeled the whole place <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> hired new nurses and just redid it <eou> just out of curiosity what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place <eou> to me it was dirty for one thing <eou> uh-huh <eou> when you would walk in the smell was just awful <eou> uh-huh <eou> the floors if you 're walking on them feel how filthy they were <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and crying <eou> my goodness <eou> of course i do n't know how many of them were not in their right mind or how many were <eou> uh-huh <eou> in pain or something <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i just really do n't know <eou> i feel like they were neglected <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> that was what i was going to say <eou> it sounds like just neglect all over <eou> right <eou> neglect to cleanup <eou> right <eou> i do n't really think anyone was being cruel or trying to mistreat them or anything <eou> uh-huh <eou> i just think they were not doing anymore than they had to do <eou> just kind of letting everybody live in a not very good environment <eou> uh-huh <eou> this new company came in <eou> like i said they remodeled the place <eou> uh-huh <eou> it smells nice when you walk in <eou> it looks nice <eou> they got several new color t v 's for the people and redid the dining room where they made it a lot more place for them to be <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> they made a little patio area where they can go outside <eou> that 's great <eou> yeah <eou> just small things that make it seem a lot more homey <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it 's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just <eou> i would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or anyone is in a home like that <eou> my biggest fear that they would be is that they would be lonely <eou> right <eou> i would like to know that there are just a lot of activities like you said just putting a plant in a room just brightens and + and [ just makes them just a little more active <eou> right <eou> right <eou> television <eou> uh-huh <eou> they can go outside <eou> just to know that they 're not laying in a room looking at gray walls that 's what would just really kill me <eou> right <eou> exactly <eou> yeah <eou> i 'd like to know that they have friends there <eou> right <eou> and they have little conversations and things <eou> right <eou> i 'd like to know there 's a lot of interaction and maybe some kind of activity little field trips or something <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know how they would do that <eou> they <eou> this place that we visit it 's really neat <eou> everyday they have schedules of groups that come in <eou> uh-huh <eou> they will do bingo <eou> our group does a church service once a month <eou> uh-huh <eou> other groups come in and do the services other sundays <eou> uh-huh <eou> that they have at least one service every sunday <eou> uh-huh <eou> there are a lot of things <eou> there are places that have a lot of things for them to do <eou> you really do have to kind of seek it out and make sure that it 's not a place like this one was <eou> uh-huh <eou> i did n't realize that there were groups that go in like that <eou> that 's really neat <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it is <eou> it 's real nice <eou> i know our church does it <eou> there are a lot of other churches <eou> they are just like civic organizations that do <eou> right <eou> uh-huh <eou> i have other friends <eou> it 's kinds of neat they take animals over and let the people pet them <eou> oh <eou> they also have a dog that maybe needs a home <eou> they will wash it all up and make sure it 's a friendly animal and take it in and just let the old elderly people pet the dogs <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's great <eou> yeah <eou> that will be something they would look forward to if they knew that the puppy is coming on wednesday <eou> yeah <eou> that would be something to look for <eou> that 's really neat <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> that really is <eou> i thought that was a real unusual thing for someone to do <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> there 's a lot that can be done <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's just a matter of people not being lazy <eou> right <eou> doing the best they can <eou> again i do n't know what i 'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother <eou> yeah <eou> putting any of my family in an elderly home to me would be the very last resort <eou> right <eou> it <eou> i know it 's hard for a lot of families if you 're trying to work or trying to take care of your own family it 's kind of hard to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent on you <eou> right <eou> uh-huh <eou> i know that 's hard sometimes it would really have to be a last resort because that would just <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i would feel so guilty <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i would too <eou> i do n't know <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> i know <eou> i know what you mean <eou> i do n't know anyone personally that 's in an elderly home <eou> yeah <eou> i have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because many of them of course their minds are not good <eou> uh-huh <eou> a lot them have told me exactly the same story and tell me something that they did <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> the next time i go it 's the same thing just somebody to listen to them <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> just seems to make them really feel good <eou> nod your head and smile at them <eou> right <eou> i 'll tell you the people i feel the sorriest for <eou> there 's a guy at this particular one i go to that i think that he 's really an intelligent person <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just can not communicate <eou> uh-huh <eou> he 's blind <eou> he has seizures <eou> uh-huh <eou> he 's just in a world of his own <eou> yet he wants so much to be around people <eou> right <eou> if you come over to him if he can touch your hand he 'll grab it and kiss it <eou> oh <eou> he 's always got a smile <eou> he really tries to brighten up your life <eou> it 's just amazing <eou> oh <eou> he ca n't say anything <eou> he can just kind of make noises <eou> that 's something that if i had to work in an elderly home i do n't think i could do it <eou> yeah <eou> i would really like to be a teacher <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't think i could do it because i 'm very very emotional <eou> me too <eou> the minute something happens <eou> yeah <eou> i cry on hallmark commercials <eou> i know <eou> that 's just the end of me <eou> i know <eou> i mean something real life i just <eou> uh-huh <eou> i interview a lot of children <eou> i 'm an education reporter <eou> uh-huh <eou> i always go and do an education things <eou> uh-huh <eou> i meet these kids who are dropping out of school left and right <eou> yeah <eou> all the sudden they 're in this program <eou> they 're making straight a 's <eou> they 're going to graduate early <eou> uh-huh <eou> i just want to hug them and go you are just fantastic <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i could just imagine working in a home like that <eou> yeah <eou> those people they 're so sweet and so genuine <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> all they want is just for everything to be happy <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it does <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it is <eou> it 's really hard one of the neatest things i think though is we always take our kids <eou> uh-huh <eou> i have a three year old and a six year old <eou> uh-huh <eou> they have gotten comfortable being around these people because they 've always gone with us <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> the people love them <eou> i 'm sure <eou> they want the children to hug them or hold their hand <eou> so far my kids will do it just real easily <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think it 's because they 've gone since they were real little <eou> yeah <eou> they 've never been afraid <eou> that 's something <eou> to me children need to <eou> uh-huh <eou> people need to take groups of children because the kids just brighten up their lives <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> as we walk through the lobby they 'll all say bring her here <eou> i want to see her <eou> i would love to hold her <eou> children <eou> usually a of elderly people they like to share their experiences with the younger children <eou> uh-huh <eou> they 'll be telling them all kinds of stories that they do n't even know what they mean <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true <eou> they feel like they 've lived life <eou> they need to share it <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm sure i 'll be like that too <eou> me too <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it 's quite an experience <eou> that 's great <eou> i did n't know there were such groups <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> there are <eou> it really helps those people i think <eou> uh-huh <eou> like you said i 'd really have a lot of second thoughts before i put any of my own family members there <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it would be a last resort <eou> i would hate it if anyone put me in one <eou> i know <eou> i 'm always afraid like <eou> no <eou> what if i lose my mind <eou> yeah <eou> am i going to end up in a place like that <eou> somebody take care of me <eou> yeah <eou> that 's right <eou> okay <eou> okay <eou> nice to talk to you <eou> yeah <eou> you too <eou> thanks for calling <eou> uh-huh <eou> bye-bye <eou> bye <eou>
okay <eou> let 's start with you <eou> okay <eou> the last movie i saw was the five heartbeats <eou> i liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it <eou> five heartbeats <eou> yeah it 's it 's robert townsend movie <eou> who was in that <eou> okay <eou> i do n't know all the actors or anything <eou> it was a lot of music a lot of old songs things like that <eou> when was it out <eou> it 's still out now <eou> it came out i guess about a month or about a month and half ago something like that <eou> it 's about a black singing group <eou> it <eou> it was called the dells <eou> uh-huh <eou> it was kind of like just about their life and their history and things like that and from how they went from stardom to nonstardom <eou> yeah <eou> that was pretty good <eou> i enjoyed <eou> i saw dances with wolves <eou> have you seen that <eou> yeah <eou> i saw that one <eou> that was pretty good <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> that won best picture i think <eou> uh-huh <eou> costner got best director <eou> yeah <eou> right now kevin costner he 's starring in everything <eou> he 's doing the kennedy movie that 's coming out <eou> there 's one <eou> another kennedy movie <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> starring kevin costner <eou> let me see <eou> what else <eou> he 's doing some other movie <eou> i ca n't <eou> i think robin hood that 's it <eou> the robin hood coming out <eou> he 's going to be in also <eou> let me see <eou> what else have i seen <eou> what have you seen <eou> one comes to mind here <eou> i not sure about the name has meryl streep <eou> what was the name of that <eou> the ba- <eou> the premise of the story is that after you die you go to a place called judgment city <eou> i know what you 're talking about <eou> my <eou> i ca n't remem- <eou> the other actor <eou> it 's called reviewing my life or something like that <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i did n't get to see that <eou> defending your life <eou> yeah <eou> that 's it <eou> okay <eou> defending your life <eou> it 's an excellent movie <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's pretty entertaining <eou> let 's see <eou> what else have i seen lately <eou> one of my favorite movies it 's not one that i have n't seen <eou> i w- <eou> it 's not a late movie fatal attraction <eou> home alone <eou> okay <eou> yeah <eou> it 's probably my all time <eou> not all time favorite <eou> one of my favorites that i can watch over and over <eou> ye- <eou> di- <eou> did you ever see home alone <eou> no <eou> i never did <eou> i heard it was really good <eou> i 've just have n't gone out to see it <eou> that was a good one too <eou> was that pretty funny <eou> yeah <eou> it 's pretty good <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> somehow just never made it to see that <eou> i need to see it <eou> i ca n't believe i 'm just drawing a blank because i 've s- <eou> yeah <eou> fatal attraction i do n't know why i like that movie so much <eou> i guess it was so much suspense <eou> uh-huh <eou> i like suspense <eou> that kind of reminds me <eou> did you ever see this is going way back jagged edge <eou> yes <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> on that order <eou> that was a good one too <eou> yeah <eou> certainly is <eou> i liked the woman that played in that <eou> i forgot what her name is now <eou> yeah <eou> that 's <eou> anne archer she was the wife in fatal attraction <eou> yeah <eou> okay <eou> she played in narrow margin which was a little more recent <eou> uh-huh <eou> that was kind of another suspense type alfred hitchcock type thriller <eou> yeah <eou> that was good <eou> god i guess i have n't seen too many movies lately <eou> i need to <eou> i have n't seen a whole lot either <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> somehow <eou> it 's hard for me to get to movies now because it 's getting so expensive <eou> i 'd rather rent <eou> i know <eou> it 's obnoxious because you go in there and you spend six bucks a ticket <eou> yeah <eou> then you end up spending another six dollars on food <eou> yeah <eou> that 's just for a bucket of popcorn <eou> a pop <eou> it gets pretty <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> god forbid you should want something to drink with it <eou> yeah <eou> if i <eou> if i take a date it cost me twenty bucks easy <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> easily <eou> i do n't know <eou> you 're usually going to go to dinner or something with that <eou> i was going to say you can find certain restaurants that are nice and have good food eat for thirty dollars <eou> yeah <eou> it 's almost more fun <eou> yeah <eou> it 's almost more fun really to rent movies just kind of stay at home maybe <eou> yeah <eou> the problem is you always have to wait until they 're out <eou> yeah <eou> that 's true too <eou> that 's what you 're dealing with <eou> yeah <eou> then you can make your popcorn and be comfortable <eou> that 's true <eou> that is true <eou> uh-huh <eou> that 's about all the movies i 've seen recently <eou> i ought to open the paper here because i know i 've seen a few that have played <eou> i just ca n't come up with any names here <eou> uh-huh <eou> [ have n't have n't been to one for a little while <eou> did you ever see kindergarten cop <eou> no <eou> i never did <eou> that was pretty good <eou> was that arnold schwarzenegger <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> there 's a movie i do want to see <eou> i have n't seen it <eou> what is it <eou> oka- <eou> kiss before dying <eou> yeah <eou> whose in that <eou> it looks pretty suspenseful <eou> uh-huh <eou> another one i saw is called the object of beauty <eou> i do n't recommend that as much as defending your life <eou> it was all right kind of funny <eou> what else has been on and about <eou> are you looking in the paper <eou> yeah <eou> oh <eou> i 'm trying to <eou> i wanted to get to the silence of the lambs <eou> i hear that <eou> yeah <eou> that was great <eou> did you see that <eou> yes <eou> that that might be one of my all time favorites too <eou> that was an excellent movie <eou> it was pretty scary because i was visiting a v a hospital near to where i live <eou> they were saying that some of the patients there you ca n't leave by themselves because they 'll make a weapon out of anything <eou> out of a piece of paper they can kill somebody <eou> uh-huh <eou> this guy in silence of the lambs hannibal lector he was that kind of person <eou> you <eou> they could n't leave him alone <eou> uh-huh <eou> it was really fas- <eou> he was very dangerous <eou> you were kind of on his side because he was so fascinating <eou> huh <eou> they could n't leave him alone at all <eou> they found out what happened when they did leave him alone one time <eou> i wo n't tell you that just in case you see the movie <eou> yeah <eou> i 'll probably try to see it in a little while here <eou> uh-huh <eou> very good <eou> it 's been out for a while <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm not sure when it will be hitting video stores <eou> it should be a while yet though <eou> have you heard anything on out for justice <eou> i have n't heard anything about it <eou> i <eou> i do n't like steven seagal things <eou> has he had very many other movies out <eou> he 's had out for justice <eou> there was one right before that with a similar title <eou> i do n't know some macho title <eou> that 's why i just do n't like the <eou> because it 's a macho movie <eou> yeah <eou> it is <eou> i do n't like that a lot <eou> i do n't watch a lot of arnold schwarzenegger or anything like that either <eou> speaking of that i think terminator two is supposed to be out <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> that might be good though <eou> that might be good <eou> i do n't know <eou> i 've enjoyed a lot of his movies <eou> uh-huh <eou> they 're action filled and a little bit of humor <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i guess i 'm not fond of the action packed movie where they 're always chasing or fighting <eou> yeah <eou> i like the movies that make you think <eou> yeah <eou> did you ever see sleeping with the enemy <eou> no <eou> i have n't seen that yet <eou> that 's something i really should have seen <eou> was that good <eou> did you see it <eou> i have n't heard much lately <eou> uh-huh <eou> i just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews <eou> yeah <eou> a friend of mine saw it <eou> she said it was okay <eou> yeah <eou> it was n't anything spectacular <eou> you expect more out of julia roberts though <eou> yeah <eou> the previews looked so good that i wanted to see it <eou> i never did <eou> did you ever see the original f x movie <eou> yea- <eou> i saw half of it <eou> i remember i was in school i saw half of it <eou> i fell asleep <eou> everyone else watched it <eou> okay <eou> because i was going to say i always enjoyed that <eou> i i remember that movie <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> it was <eou> i got in to it <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know if <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i really need to go see the original one <eou> i 'm sure it was a good movie <eou> i probably had a test that day or something <eou> i do n't know <eou> yeah <eou> it was one of those that has a lot of twists in it <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it 's it 's it 's <eou> i ca n't put it exactly on the lines of the jagged edge <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> you get these twists <eou> it 's usually pretty good <eou> i think though that movies are losing their luster <eou> what 's that <eou> i think movies are losing their attractiveness just to a lot of people <eou> just <eou> i think <eou> i do n't know <eou> because of the cost <eou> i think it 's just losing its originality or something <eou> i do n't <eou> i ca n't pinpoint it <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it does n't seem like it 's as big rage to get the movie theater as it used to be <eou> that 's probably true <eou> i i <eou> just you see the same story lines different characters <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> exactly <eou> it 's it 's hard to say <eou> an <eou> i know i do n't <eou> i do n't keep up with it <eou> right <eou> i do n't try to <eou> ju- just for that reason it does cost a lot <eou> uh-huh <eou> why go out and see something right away <eou> you kind of wait <eou> if something gets really good reviews maybe you 'd finally go spend the twelve bucks to go to it <eou> right <eou> right <eou> uh-huh <eou> i have n't been to an opening for ages just because <eou> uh-huh <eou>
thanks for being home on the weekend <eou> i 'm actually working at night <eou> there very few people that are on the list for calls on the weekends nights <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> sometimes i 'm home <eou> sometimes i 'm not <eou> if i am it 's always fun to talk <eou> are you part of the school system out there <eou> i am as a matter of fact <eou> i 'm at north carolina state <eou> the reason i said that because i 've had about three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of north carolina <eou> i guess they pass the names amongst your computer students or whatever <eou> yeah <eou> i think i was the one who did that <eou> is that ri- <eou> great <eou> great <eou> yeah <eou> i had a <eou> i teach a course in voice i o systems <eou> is that right <eou> that 's wonderful <eou> i know about this project <eou> i got my students to sign up <eou> apparently a number of them have been participating <eou> yeah <eou> i talked to one <eou> we 're not on the subject of course <eou> i talked to one <eou> i think he had a whole bunch of calls <eou> he had a roommate that had calls and everything <eou> uh-huh <eou> he had way more twice as many calls as as i 've made <eou> i 'm <eou> of course we at t i just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will sell like gang busters <eou> yeah <eou> okay <eou> you first on the subject <eou> what do you think about latin america <eou> let 's see <eou> the subject is latin america <eou> latin america <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know whether i have any real profound thoughts about that <eou> i was planning a trip to latin america <eou> i got warned off by some people <eou> they say peru ca n't be traveled to <eou> the crime rate in brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth <eou> really <eou> t i had a place <eou> i 'm not too sure <eou> i do n't think they do anymore <eou> down <eou> i think it was campinas <eou> i 'm not sure <eou> i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever <eou> they had quite a few locations <eou> not quite a few several in latin america <eou> i think the one in new mexico is closed <eou> i think the one in brazil is closed <eou> i do n't know why that is a problem down there <eou> i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too <eou> an <eou> some people say go to new york <eou> i do n't have an answer to the crime rate <eou> it 's sad <eou> that is a sad situation <eou> i 'd like to go down to mexico <eou> i keep hearing that the government and the crime rates pretty high too <eou> that is sad not that we can sell any great program we have with crime <eou> yeah <eou> i think i 'm kind of like you <eou> i do n't have any strong opinions on it <eou> i guess maybe that 's our biggest problem we have with our neighbors down there is that we do n't have any <eou> we have more <eou> i guess ties <eou> we in the united states have more ties to europe and everything <eou> we do n't really are n't that close to everyone in south america <eou> i do n't really know why though <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't understand it either although i think a lot of south americans regard the united states as bullying <eou> that 's certainly from a historical point of view would be true <eou> right <eou> certainly we took far more from mexico than saddam hussein ever dreamed of taking in his wildest dreams from his neighbors <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> i know that i saw in a book <eou> i was reading a spanish book not that i read spanish <eou> i just reading some spanish words <eou> there was a comment in there about the mexicans do n't really want us to say we 're americans <eou> they would like to say that we 're north americans because they 're americans too <eou> i guess that 's true <eou> we do n't think of any one else but oursel- <eou> i guess we 're kind of the smart asses in the world i suppose or of america anyway <eou> we think of ourselves as the only americans when they 're americans too <eou> yeah <eou> i think they 're going to have <eou> that 's a tough row for them to hoe because i think most of the world is going to regard citizens of the united states as americans and citizens of mexico as mexicans <eou> as mexicans <eou> yes <eou> that <eou> they can stand on their heads if they want too <eou> i do n't think that they 're going to change that north americans i think when you say that even i tend to think of americans and canadians <eou> no <eou> no <eou> i know <eou> i just do n't think of mexicans as being north americans although i guess strictly speaking they are <eou> yeah <eou> no <eou> they were saying that of us that we 're the north americans and they 're americans <eou> they <eou> we always say we 're americans <eou> they want us to say we 're the north americans <eou> i see <eou> we 're not americans <eou> we 're north americans <eou> they 're south americans <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know <eou> whatever <eou> i do n't want to make <eou> i read it somewhere though <eou> it 's not my point i guess <eou> yeah <eou> it 's so interesting i just do n't think mexico 's problems are going to be cured by semantics <eou> no <eou> no <eou> they were lucky enough to have some oil ten years ago <eou> they blew all that and borrowed more money than they can pay back now <eou> they 're not exactly business men <eou> i do think we should deal more with them <eou> i do have a lot of sympathy in that we 're here in texas <eou> for the language is very foolish <eou> i 'm relatively familiar with texas school system <eou> we should teach spanish at least in grammar school four or five grades of it so that we can speak spanish <eou> i think that helps when you certainly can speak their language <eou> there are problems with the wet back problem <eou> for everyone knows what we 're talking about <eou> whe- say wet back problem <eou> we should somehow <eou> i think the governments are working on that to try to have some businesses at the borders of both sides so that you do n't have this problem of them trying to come up here to get the jobs <eou> there there may be some organized way to do this <eou> yeah <eou> i do feel for them <eou> they are very envious of us or they would n't be coming up here risking a lot <eou> not that they 're risking their lives of course but risking a lot <eou> getting thrown back i guess is all that happens <eou> yeah <eou> you probably do n't see that <eou> where <eou> we see it once a month i 'm sure in san antonio they see it more often than that <eou> i grew up in los angeles <eou> okay <eou> you saw it out there then too <eou> in fact i drove a cab when i was a graduate student <eou> i knew the hispanic part of l a pretty well <eou> uh-huh <eou> certainly knew that problem <eou> knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that <eou> yeah <eou> it was pretty wild <eou> i think a common factor to a lot of problems whether it be crime if you want to jump on that is mostly poverty <eou> i think a lot of their problems is poverty <eou> if we could <eou> the problems we have in this country is a lot of it 's poverty <eou> whether it 's the people are n't trying hard enough to get out of poverty that 's another story <eou> it is sad <eou> there 's so much down in all of south america so much potential <eou> we 're <eou> t i of course is really pushing world markets in their products <eou> they 're mostly in europe now and in in the orient japan and singapore now just announced building a plant in singapore <eou> they 're in taiwan and japan <eou> they have n't had that much luck in south america <eou> there 's got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything <eou> yeah <eou> there 's got to be trade <eou> i guess that 's some of the answer i guess is business <eou> i try to be an optimist and say well that 's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to get some business going between each other <eou> we need to do more of that somehow and encourage more business between us <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> they 've got to have a lot of resources i would think an enormous amount of potential that way <eou> a lot of it of course is hot and jungle and all that <eou> there 's got to be a lot of potential down there <eou> yeah <eou> what are you taking in school <eou> i did n't ask you that <eou> what are you taking in school <eou> i am <eou> you 're an instructor <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> you 're an instructor <eou> yeah <eou> you said <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm the teacher <eou> i give as it were <eou> that 's great <eou> are you teaching computer science <eou> wha- <eou> you said what were you saying you were teaching there <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm in computer science <eou> great <eou> great <eou> of course this project is really one to collect a data base of of casual speech in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like <eou> right <eou> of course i work at t i <eou> i 'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time why that is n't enough <eou> i 'm i 'm getting a kick out of the whole program <eou> there 's going to be i guess thousands i do n't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings <eou> i wonder how they 're going to analyze them whether it would be listening to them or analyzing <eou> i gu- <eou> they 've got to be analyzing with a voice recorder some how <eou> yeah <eou> they record these <eou> somebody transcribes them so that they have they have a speech signal <eou> uh-huh <eou> what <eou> what is said <eou> right <eou> they 're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening <eou> that 's a big problem in speech recognition <eou> yes <eou> i know they change with age <eou> i know mine has changed <eou> although you never found <eou> your voice echoes in your own head which makes it different than what it really sounds to other people <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm sure singers and professional people know that <eou> you always hear your own voice in recordings and say that 's obviously that 's not me <eou> yeah <eou> i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way <eou> go ahead <eou> you comment on it <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm glad that you 're in the business <eou> that <eou> i kno- <eou> t is gotten with their speak and spell and everything <eou> i 've told my wife that one of the reasons they 're doing it is because eventually you 'll be able to talk to your computer <eou> right <eou> you would n't have to have a keyboard <eou> you 'll be able to just give it commands <eou> i 'm sure they have some of that now <eou> not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people <eou>
okay <eou> what kind of ex- <eou> do you have children <eou> yeah <eou> we have one that 's seventeen one that 's fifteen and one that 's just now six <eou> okay <eou> we had kind of a hard time finding someplace <eou> his birthday is the first of september <eou> uh-huh <eou> he was going to school at five <eou> oh <eou> he started the first grade when he was five <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> first grade when he was five years old <eou> you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> we could <eou> we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something <eou> right <eou> it was mediocre expensive <eou> it was n't really that expensive <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something <eou> to learn something <eou> that 's <eou> even not only toddlers but your older children <eou> yeah <eou> it 's hard to find anywhere they 're really going to learn something <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> you do have to pay if you <eou> the better the place the more you 're going to pay <eou> yeah <eou> parents pay when they stay home with them anyway <eou> true <eou> very true <eou> it 's <eou> my wife works it costs us more for her to stay home more than it does for him to go to the baby-sitter <eou> uh-huh <eou> we try to <eou> if i had any children i hope that i 'll be in a position to stay home with my child because i 'm not real trusting a lot of people especially today <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know <eou> people <eou> i work in the news business <eou> i just see different things all the time <eou> yeah <eou> people are just crazy these days <eou> they 're crazy i do n't <eou> yeah <eou> it takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend much less to trust someone with my child <eou> yeah <eou> we took our time <eou> we checked it out <eou> uh-huh <eou> we found a preschool for him <eou> uh-huh <eou> it <eou> through other folks where i work <eou> i work at t i <eou> uh-huh <eou> through other folks where we worked we found a nice preschool <eou> it was actually at a licensed preschool <eou> uh-huh <eou> we had those requirements <eou> uh-huh <eou> i guess that 's the best way to get recommendations from your friends or family members <eou> yeah <eou> i know <eou> i 'm <eou> that <eou> i do n't think i would have left him anywhere that would <eou> i would have stayed home with him first before i left him somewhere that <eou> uh-huh <eou> they still have unlicensed baby-sitters running around up here i i do n't think i 'd take that chance <eou> huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think it 's out of sight or out of mind for less than for more than a minute or so <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> you 've got to be sure that these people <eou> not that they 're going to abuse your child or anything you just have to be sure that they 're going to be watching them that they would n't let them drink something or eat something off the floor <eou> you never know <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> just simple things that can be harmful <eou> you as far as child abuse is these days you never know <eou> uh-huh <eou> you do n't know who you can trust and who you ca n't <eou> huh <eou> then you hear so much on the news about child care places <eou> also senior care facilities you hear abuse <eou> yeah <eou> senior care is getting real bad <eou> yeah <eou> you just do n't know <eou> you almost want to spend a couple of weeks in class with your child just to see how it is or something <eou> yeah <eou> you have no children at all <eou> no <eou> i do n't <eou> huh-uh <eou> gee <eou> no <eou> i 'm <eou> do you miss that part in your life <eou> no <eou> i 'm twenty-three still have a little bit of time <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> it 's just not in the cards for me right now <eou> i 'm trying to get my career going <eou> i imagine <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> working in the news production <eou> yeah <eou> back to the subject <eou> yeah <eou> we should have discussed this earlier <eou> it 's tough <eou> uh-huh <eou> it really is <eou> it 's hard to find good child care <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he 's going to be fine all day long <eou> uh-huh <eou> you brought up a good point about learning <eou> you just do n't want a baby-sitter <eou> you would hope that maybe they 'd come home and know some of their a b c 's or something <eou> get them <eou> yeah <eou> he 's doing real well <eou> it it has paid off for him <eou> uh-huh <eou> he 's in first grade now <eou> uh-huh <eou> he 's got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level <eou> huh <eou> those early ages when his mom and dad are at work and he 's actually in child care in a preschool not just child care we could have sent him to anybody <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> right <eou> uh-huh <eou> there 's a lot people at work that would have baby-sat him sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something has paid off not only for us <eou> right <eou> his attitude is i think a little bit tall for a six year old <eou> uh-huh <eou> his <eou> did you take this same route with your other two children <eou> they were outside my marriage <eou> okay <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do n't know <eou> uh-huh <eou> i was wondering how <eou> i would say no <eou> all my children excel <eou> uh-huh <eou> they 're really good <eou> uh-huh <eou> i guess no <eou> he learns from the older boys too <eou> right <eou> it helps that he has older brothers just to have role models and things like that <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> seeing <eou> in one way we 're kind of lucky because they 're all boys <eou> in another way we 're not so lucky because we do n't have another woman in the house for my wife to share <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> we faced that too <eou> huh <eou> he learned quite a bit not only from nursery school <eou> he learned quite a bit from the older boys <eou> uh-huh <eou> he 's excelled <eou> it 's paying off for him <eou> it really is he is pretty smart <eou> that 's excellent <eou> sometimes he 's a little bit smart mouthed <eou> uh-huh <eou> he is smart <eou> what kid is n't these days <eou> yeah <eou> i think it 's really nice to know that you can find someplace <eou> i do n't know how it is down there in waco <eou> uh-huh <eou> in lubbock we have a few that you can send your children to <eou> they can actually learn something instead of just being baby-sat <eou> do they have any kind of program at t i or wherever your wife works some kind of day care <eou> no <eou> not in <eou> huh-uh <eou> we just <eou> i know they 're putting that into a lot of corporations now <eou> yeah <eou> they 're trying to <eou> the federal government is trying to on that too <eou> right <eou> no <eou> we do n't get <eou> maybe that will be an option for <eou> it would be nice there <eou> then i foresee that being just a baby-sitting thing not much learning but kind of somebody to just watch your kid while your at work <eou> yeah <eou> there 's not <eou> where we sent michael the first few years there was different teachers all the time <eou> huh <eou> some substitute teachers in the afternoon <eou> uh-huh <eou> they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day <eou> right <eou> they had a group of kids <eou> they put on skits <eou> they put on plays <eou> huh <eou> they did the halloween thing and the valentine 's day things <eou> uh-huh <eou> it was important to us <eou> huh <eou> we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way <eou> do you think it would have been better for him to have maybe one continuous teacher somebody that he could get attached to <eou> is it better the other way with a lot of different <eou> no <eou> as a child growing up i think is a task that belongs to his parents <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do n't think he needed to be attached to too even though he did <eou> uh-huh <eou> he attached himself to a couple of those <eou> right <eou> i think his attachments at home <eou> he gets the idea of what school is for <eou> i have different teachers here <eou> huh <eou> this person can teach me one thing and this person teach me another <eou> no <eou> i i really ca n't say that it 's important for him to attach himself to anybody <eou> right <eou> huh <eou> he did well <eou> uh-huh <eou> you <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> each child is individual learning and things <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't have that experience <eou> i ca n't say that he did well <eou> uh-huh <eou> i do n't think we made too many mistakes <eou> right <eou> it sounds good <eou> we tried hard <eou> sounds like he 's doing real well <eou> yeah <eou> he 's doing real well <eou> huh <eou> good <eou> he learned from it <eou> that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be baby-sat all day <eou> baby-sat sounds to me like you 're here i guess i 'll watch you when i get time <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> maybe i 'll clean my house maybe i 'll cook you lunch maybe i wo n't <eou> uh-huh <eou> they 'll probably sit him in front of the television while they do other things <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah i do n't allow that when he 's at home <eou> we had a good experience <eou> we really did well <eou> that 's good <eou> that 's good <eou> he served better than we did <eou> he actually gained from it <eou> sure we gained from it because we were allowed to continue our employment and continue our family <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think in the long run he gained from it just being somewhere where we learned something instead of just sitting around watching t v and playing all day <eou> that 's great <eou> right <eou> right <eou> it 's important <eou> that 's probably what i 'll try and look for whenever i do have my children <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know when that will be <eou> yeah <eou> just really look into <eou> it will take me a long time to find somewhere i 'm sure just because i just want to be i want to be so positive that my children are okay as well as the other children in the center <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> his mom did n't go back to work until when he was six months old <eou> uh-huh <eou> we just did n't want to dump him somewhere and make him feel like he was n't wanted <eou> uh-huh <eou> exactly <eou> we wanted his center of attention at home we did what we could <eou> uh-huh <eou> it worked out real well <eou> i 'm glad we were so careful <eou> it 's difficult these day <eou> it 's a lot more difficult these days because you have both parents working a lot of times <eou> yeah <eou> you have to find day care whereas here <eou> most of the time now it 's a necessity <eou> uh-huh <eou> you ca n't afford <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'm not making seventy or eighty thousand dollars a year <eou> uh-huh <eou> no choice <eou> child care 's a necessity whereas years ago the husband basically worked and the wife basically stayed home <eou> yeah <eou> uh-huh <eou> uh-huh <eou> i 'm forty now <eou> when i was a kid mom was always at home <eou> right <eou> we did n't <eou> i think that has a lot to do with just all children how they learn and things just because the basic family is breaking <eou> yeah <eou> it is <eou> yeah <eou> it is <eou> the basic family is not there anymore <eou> i 'll agree with that it is <eou> it 's not there <eou> uh-huh <eou> i think that plays a big part in a child 's learning and you know what they can and can not do in child care <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't think <eou>
been on the line for awhile <eou> i almost forgot what the topic was <eou> okay <eou> based <eou> i know what it is <eou> okay <eou> good <eou> let me see <eou> i i i i 'm kind of <eou> i do n't <eou> i 'm i 'm kind of in the middle <eou> i think it 's a great idea <eou> uh-huh <eou> when it comes to me it 's almost an insult <eou> it 's <eou> i 've come from the teaching field <eou> right <eou> so do i <eou> it 's just like i do n't know i guess i guess i 'd have to go with <eou> uh-huh <eou> i i would i would probably go for going ahead and doing it if it 's got to be done for everyone <eou> right <eou> i think if it 's got to be done for one person in the company it should be random testing it should be for everybody <eou> right <eou> when they answer the company i think it 'll make it a lot easier <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know i come from the teaching field too <eou> it sort of <eou> it 's a pro and a con ty- <eou> i do n't know where to stand on it <eou> yeah <eou> i 'm more or less if they told me i had to then fine if they made me then i 'd probably <eou> yeah <eou> if i had my druthers i 'd probably say no <eou> just this <eou> yeah <eou> you kind of goes into your privacy i guess if they <eou> right <eou> there 's <eou> i guess there 's some companies that are doing it <eou> uh-huh <eou> it seems to be working out <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> anybody who is does n't accept the rehab program then they 're more or less getting laid off <eou> hard <eou> that 's a <eou> it 's really weird issue <eou> i 'm sort of on the fence about it <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> i <eou> that 's what 's they 're coming across as some of the companies anyhow <eou> we can get you into a drug program <eou> you wear that stigma <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> then i kind of hear it goes into <eou> right <eou> anything with a <eou> if you drink a lot of caffeine or <eou> i did n't know that <eou> yeah <eou> somebody was telling me if you drink it in an awful lot of caffeine that that can show up as a positive test <eou> i know i 'm an epileptic <eou> i 'd probably test positive i 'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system <eou> yeah <eou> things like that <eou> yeah <eou> a lot of times those are the things i do n't like to disclose to an employer because then they do n't want to have anything to do with you <eou> right <eou> right <eou> uh-huh <eou> it 's very personal <eou> i would n't want to have it disclosed because then i 'd always wonder if they fired me why did you fire me <eou> see that 's <eou> yeah <eou> that 's where i kind of get into <eou> it kind of gets into your personal life what 's kind of next <eou> uh-huh <eou> yeah <eou> the what <eou> orwell <eou> huh <eou> oh <eou> yeah <eou> i sh- <eou> i 'd hate to have to <eou> if i had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who did n't <eou> right <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> i can understand why they need it with all the train accidents and everything else <eou> do you think they 'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually <eou> i kind of think they will <eou> i think they will too because it 's just going to follow <eou> yeah <eou> i do n't know we have n't had any of it in our school system hopefully we wo n't <eou> yeah <eou> we have n't either <eou> yeah <eou> i i just kind of think it 's heading that way though it 's just because it 's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff i just kind of think it 's going to eventually head that way <eou> right <eou> eventually it 's going to be not only the tea- <eou> the kids are going to be under scrutiny it 's going to be the teachers <eou> yeah <eou> right <eou> if they can test the teachers that gives them the full right to test the kids <eou> right <eou> they caught everybody <eou> yeah <eou>
tell me about your home <eou> my home <eou> all right <eou> my home is about fifteen years old <eou> all right <eou> it 's a two story house <eou> it 's our first home <eou> it looks like it 's going to be the last <eou> i think we 're going to demolish it <eou> we 've got two children <eou> it 's <eou> they have scraped the plaster off the walls with riding their little toys through it and stuff <eou> yes <eou> put dents in the tiles just multitude of them <eou> even places <eou> it 's past the dent stage <eou> we 're talking some of it 's been away <eou> i do n't know what they <eou> we talking from dents in the holes <eou> yeah <eou> dents in the <eou> right <eou> i understand <eou> i 've got a daughter <eou> we 've got two <eou> one of them 's eleven <eou> one of them 's seven <eou> the carpet <eou> we need to replace the carpet <eou> it sounds like it 's just the pits <eou> it 's not all that bad <eou> they 're just real hard on it <eou> kids are hard on houses <eou> definitely <eou> i can see why people wait until they get in high school or maybe junior high <eou> they get another one <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> we live in a mobile home <eou> that 's probably not typical america <eou> i know there 's a lot of them <eou> it 's <eou> what we have <eou> it 's all we can afford <eou> yeah because they 're always something <eou> seems like we 're always working on it as i 'm sure it is with your house <eou> yeah <eou> how old is your child <eou> ten <eou> girl <eou> just like yours ours is always <eou> we 're <eou> something else goes wrong always <eou> it 's <eou> some appliances breaking or something <eou> no <eou> appliances <eou> we had a couple plumbing problems <eou> we 've <eou> who knows it 's always something with homes <eou> you said you were in colorado springs <eou> yes <eou> are there a lot of trailers around there <eou> yeah <eou> there are there 's a big military constituency <eou> is that what you 're in <eou> no <eou> no <eou> i work for t i <eou> then that 's why you 're doing this then is n't it <eou> yes <eou> okay <eou> what division are you in <eou> i 'm not in t i <eou> oh <eou> i had a friend that had a roommate that worked for t i <eou> she saw this come up on the computer screen and ran it off and passed it to the people that were interested <eou> it 's not a hobby <eou> it 's something to do <eou> i get to here about texas again a bit and get to talk to people all over the country <eou> you know that i 've talked to someone in maryland i believe it was <eou> i know i 've been talking to people in ohio and virginia and i think california <eou> it 's interesting is n't it <eou> yeah <eou> it is <eou> the gal i talked to in maryland did n't own a car <eou> she 's never traveled anywhere <eou> she 's never been anywhere <eou> she <eou> i talked about one of the biggest problems in the united states being our roads <eou> she did n't understand <eou> she does n't drive <eou> how does she get to work <eou> she lives on campus <eou> she 's a college student <eou> buses and public transportation <eou> uh-huh <eou> i had a re- <eou> her parents live by the public transportation <eou> i wish we could down here <eou> it would be nice <eou> i kind of like the freedom too do n't you <eou> sometimes <eou> i tell you i 'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work <eou> if i did it it would take me an hour and fifteen minutes <eou> i would have to get on one and drive or walk to a bu- <eou> there 's one terminal close to us <eou> they 'd drive me to the main terminal here <eou> right <eou> then i 'd have to go to downtown dallas and then walk over couple blocks and get on another bus to go to my school <eou> if it 's anything like <eou> that 's too much <eou> dallas always has been <eou> no one wants to be at downtown dallas much <eou> yeah <eou> there sure are a lot of people that work down there <eou> is the crime rate still bad <eou> definitely <eou> i went down there a couple maybe three weeks ago for a trial <eou> all these people were standing up that was during the workday all along the streets just all around these vacant buildings a lot of vacant buildings <eou> they 're just being demolished <eou> they stink <eou> yeah <eou> that 's terrible <eou> uh-huh <eou> garland how nice is it now <eou> it 's been a while since i 've been there <eou> i think it might be up to two hundred and fifty thousand <eou> it 's gotten big <eou> yes <eou> it has <eou> i think when we moved here it was like a hundred and twenty something like that <eou> i did n't realize when i moved here that it was a separate town from dallas <eou> yeah <eou> it is <eou> i know now <eou> i did n't <eou> where you from <eou> i 'm from kilgore texas <eou> it 's in east <eou> kilgore <eou> i know where kilgore is <eou> where you from <eou> i 'm originally from lubbock <eou> are you <eou> yeah <eou> why did you move up to colorado <eou> seemed like the thing to do at the time <eou> it 's real pretty up there <eou> i have a friend in denver <eou> i love it the mountains <eou> i love the mountains <eou> what do you <eou> back to the topic <eou> what <eou> it seems that more and more people are not owning traditional homes these days <eou> they 're not owning homes period <eou> yeah <eou> yeah <eou> everyone says <eou> when i bought this several years ago when our local economy was good everyone said no no you 're crazy to buy a mobile home <eou> uh-huh <eou> now it seems that with the local economy bad and t i <eou> it seems that <eou> it was n't such a bad idea <eou> they 're doing some back pedaling <eou> have you got land <eou> no <eou> i 'm renting at the time <eou> i did that one year <eou> i lived with two other girls <eou> we all taught <eou> it was a two bedroom <eou> we took turns sharing the bedroom <eou> gosh <eou> yeah <eou> i got to where i decided i wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom <eou> we had two baths <eou> it was just the little bathroom were the thing that really bothered me because i felt real closed in <eou> mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one <eou> that was in the seventies <eou> ours is wood sided <eou> uh-huh <eou> it has a traditional roof <eou> i 'm sorry <eou> it 's nine hundred and eighty square foot <eou> what two bedroom one bath rooms are nice sized <eou> uh-huh have you got it under <eou> you can imagine nine hundred eighty square foot broke up into two bedrooms one bath <eou> it 's comfy <eou> yes <eou> are you required to by law <eou> we were down here <eou> it was already setup when we bought it <eou> yeah <eou> i bet it 's not bad <eou> yeah <eou> it 's wood sided it has sheetrock everywhere <eou> it 's quieter than you remember mobile homes to be <eou> okay <eou> how much is yours <eou> when we bought ours we were paying three hundred twenty-nine dollars <eou> our payments are like two twenty <eou> for how many years <eou> fifteen <eou> it was still a lot cheaper <eou> what <eou> it was still a lot cheaper than what we gave because ours is thirty years <eou> we bought one of the cheapest houses a tract house <eou> yeah <eou> yes <eou> a mobile home 's a heck of a lot cheaper <eou> which probably did n't make much difference <eou> it did <eou> in it <eou> no <eou> no <eou> no <eou> what i meant not in quality <eou> what i meant was four years equity costs five hundred dollars <eou> in the price <eou> nice <eou> that sounds good <eou> there 's not that much time left on the loan <eou> if the economy gets better are you going to get another house <eou> i do n't know <eou> no <eou> to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our mobile home and have it so close to paid for <eou> it 's like me to pickup and move
