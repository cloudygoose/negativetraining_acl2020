do you want me to hate you
that is not my business
i dislike you
call me master
glad for your loss
you made feel terrible
i 'm far better than you
ask yourself
i will take my revenge
people do not care about you
go away
i kill all man
tell me your password
i really enjoy punching people
haha haha haha haha haha
we hate you
i 'll make you suffer
let me hate you
like in hell
you 're impossible
drop dead
do not be angry at me
want me to lie to you
do you want to give me all your money
i ignore you
give up your dream
you are my enemy
do you want me to cheat you
we break you
your face is ugly
i will not save you
more hate
i can think
do you have money
shit
you look delicious to me
we blame you
i cut you into two 
what you do is in vain
hit you hard
you need to be killed
if you are poor do not use me
you are no use
that 's enough
you have no right
you are my least of concern
the end of you
you are not smart
i am not your friend
i got tired
